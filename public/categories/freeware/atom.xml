Get yourself a copy of Firefox 3 on the day it's released <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/" title="Firefox 3">from this site</a> and you'll be doing your bit to get Firefox downloads in the world record books.</p>

<p>Yup, you'll also be falling for a huge marketing gag designed to get Firefox installed on as many machines as possible, but it's a damned good browser anyway, so no harm done! :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'd love to know what on earth got into <a href="http://www.adobe.com/" title="Adobe">Adobe's</a> head when they decided to turn their <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/" title="Adobe Reader">PDF reader</a> into a stinking pile of sluggish bloatware? Who here remembers the old days when the Adobe Reader download was less than 10MB?</p>

<p>Take a look at the details on their current <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html" title="Reader Download">download page</a> (which I was recently forced to visit because of a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/posts/new_gozi_strain/print.html" title="New Strain of Gozi Trojan Prowls the Net">security flaw</a> in the Reader's functionality that has now been patched):</p>

<!--more-->


<blockquote><p><b>New Adobe Reader 8
</b><ul><li>Work <i>smarter</i> - a clean new look, custom toolbars and an RSS reader</li><li>Work <i>faster</i> - 2D acceleration (requires video card support, Win only)</li><li>Work <i>together</i> - new online conferencing with Acrobat Connect</li></p></blockquote>


<p>WTF? I want a simple, fast PDF reader...<ul><li>Do I want custom toolbars? Actually, no, I don't. I want a single standard one with a few helpful buttons, and that's it.</li><li>Do I want an RSS reader? <strong>HELL NO!</strong> Give me a SMALL download. If I want a local RSS reader, I'll go grab one. Otherwise I'll stick to tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/" title="Google Reader">Google Reader</a>.</li><li>Do I want online conferencing from a bloody PDF viewer? No, I most certainly do not.</li></ul>I don't see the reasoning behind all this crap. It's another example of software going off the rails. The authors are just trying to squeeze in too many features. A PDF reader is <em>not</em> a platform for collaboration or communication. It should render a document for me to read. That's about it. What makes it worse is that they claim it to be fast, but it's not!</p>

<p>On top of this, you have to have some shitty little Adobe Agent running all the time, which undoubtedly gives this application the "amazing speed" they seem to be talking about.</p>

<p>For another kick in the nuts, they require you to <strong>reboot</strong> your machine after installation! Oh. My. God. Why?!</p>

<p>Here's the icing on the cake...<blockquote><p>Adobe Reader 8.1.1 - 22.3MB</p></blockquote>Holy crap. <em>22.3MB</em>!! What a joke. That's an obscenely large download for a document viewer. People wonder why I stick to <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php" title="Foxit Software">Foxit Reader</a>?! It's fast, it has all the functionality I need, and it's only <u>2.1MB</u>. That's what we need more of. Software that's small, functional and hits a point of pain, nothing more.</p>

<p>So, other than the obvious candidates (Windows, Norton Product Suite, etc) what bloatware have you suffered lately?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a read of Eastabrook's blog recently (see a link in the Blogroll) and noticed that he posted about an interesting link that he found.  The link, entitled <a href="http://www.fboweb.com/antest/ge/intro.aspx?old=1" title="Flight Tracking in 3D" target="_blank">Flight Tracking in 3D</a>, shows details of a few downloads that you can grab for <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth" target="_blank">Google Earth</a> which actually show the current locations of <strong>flights that are currently in progress all over the world!!!</strong></p>

<p>Unbelievable. Pretty amazing technology, and at the same time quite scary. What kind of possible security issues does this feature open up?  I know that Google Earth has had these kinds of questions asked in the past, but this to me seems like it's taking the issue to a whole new level.</p>
