I won't go into the reasons here, nor the way I came to that conclusion. What I will say is that I wish I'd listened to my inner-8-year-old-self when I started down the thread of emails and Tweets you're about to read.</p>

<p>Suffice is to say that I have learned my lesson!</p>

<p>The thread speaks for itself. Enjoy :)</p>

Sorry to hear of your issues. The image that you have sent me is extremely poor quality and I'm unable to read it. <br />
Please send a screenshot as a PNG/JPG or just copy and paste the text into an email. Don't use word.<br />

Thank you. You are right! Even uninstall word cannot fix of the site.<br />

Alwyn,<br />
<br />
Make sure you read what I am saying, and read it properly. I never once told you to uninstall Word, I just told you not to use it to send me the details of your issue.<br />
<br />
Citrix shouldn't stop you from copying and pasting, but if it does, take a screenshot like you did before and open "Paint". you should find it in the "accessories menu". when you've opened paint, paste the screenshot in there, and save the image as a jpg, png or bmp. Then attach that to an email and send it to me.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I am not giving out fax or skype details. Trust me, you're getting way more out of this than you deserve.<br />

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are a collection of quotes that can drive fear into the heart of every developer. They're made worse when heard at the start of a new gig, as any hope of a brave new world is smashed before you even get a login!</p>

<!--more-->


<ol>
<li>We are using Agile, but have made a few adjustments.</li>
<li>We need to make some changes to an application in production, but we don't have the source code any more.</li>
<li>How's your Excel/VBA?</li>
<li>We'll worry about testing later.</li>
<li>Make sure you abstract the database layer, just in case we want to switch from SQL 2005 to db4o.</li>
<li>We make heavy use of enterprise design patterns, especially inversion of control and dependency injection. We don't want to be tightly coupled to <em>anything</em>.</li>
<li>We have a Biztalk license.</li>
<li>In the interim, can you please work on these reports?</li>
<li>We use the latest and greatest technology, such as SQL 2000 and .NET v1.1.</li>
<li>We have written our own framework and code generator.</li>
<li>Have you ever written any Cobol?</li>
<li>We have the work but it hasn't been approved yet.</li>
<li>We use VSS 6.0 for Version Control. -- <em>Inspired by M Princz (below)</em></li>
<li>All testing is done by the BAs. -- <em>Inspired by M Princz (below)</em></li>
<li>We're using Great Plains for timesheets.</li>
<li>We've got a stack of 3rd party UI controls that we don't use any more, but we have to link them in otherwise the back-end code breaks. -- <em>Inspired by JoCo</em></li>
</ol>


<p>There are lots more, but I've forgotten them. I'll be sure to add them as I remember.</p>

<p>... any suggestions?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've never been one to make New Years Resolutions. I think they're a bit of a wank to be honest. But I do love a good gimmick. So when I stumbled on <a href="http://resolutionrandomizer.pop.us/ecard.aspx" title="Resolution Randomizer">this</a> I both loved and hated it.</p>

<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/12/res_1.png" title="Resolution 1" rel="lightbox[resolutions]"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/12/res_1.png" alt="Resolution 1" style="border: 0; float: left; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/></a> This first attempt made me chuckle. I think all the time, let alone at inappropriate times. The bigger question is: <em>what should I be thinking about at inappropriate times?</em>.</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>

<div style="float:none; clear:both;"></div>


<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/12/res_2.png" title="Resolution 2" rel="lightbox[resolutions]"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/12/res_2.png" alt="Resolution 2" style="border: 0; float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/></a>After this second one appeared I thought that this thing knew more about me than I felt comfortable about. So I stopped right there.</p>

<p>This is quite a neat little Silverlight app. One that I think most people will get a kick out of, even if it's just for a few minutes. Enjoy.</p>

<li><em>getroman</em> - That's my superhero name.</li>
<li><em>optus bastards</em> - You got that right!</li>
