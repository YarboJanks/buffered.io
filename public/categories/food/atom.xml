    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a very long time since I last ate fast food (such as McDonalds, KFC or Hungry Jacks). In fact, it&rsquo;s been <em>years</em>, because I just can&rsquo;t stand the stuff and I know it&rsquo;s really bad for me.</p>

<p>When it comes to other types of junk I&rsquo;m pretty good. The only time I ever eat potato chips is when my mate Mike pops round and brings them with him. I never buy them myself, and they don&rsquo;t make it into our shopping cart when we buy groceries.  I never eat doughnuts any more. I don&rsquo;t remember the last doughnut that I ate, that&rsquo;s how long ago it was.</p>

<p>So, you can probably imagine how happy I was that my junk food habits are very minimal (chocolate being the only contender, and even that doesn&rsquo;t make a frequent appearance) when Amy sent a link to me <a href="http://vitalvotes.com/blogs/public_blog/More-Reasons-to-Avoid-Potato-Chips-4439.aspx" title="" target="_blank">describing some stuff that happens during potato chip/doughnut manufacture</a>. In essense, eating this kind of junk food is horrendously bad for you.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s not good for a biodiesel car engine, how can it be good for the human body?</p>
