    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given my renewed focus on security I've been looking to lock down much of my communications so that I <em>feel</em> more secure online. One of the things that I use quite a lot to connect with people who know WTF they're talking about is IRC. <a href="https://freenode.net/" title="Freenode IRC network">#freenode</a> is my network of choice as it has a bunch of interesting places with fairly active communities. <a href="http://www.irssi.org/" title="irssi IRC client">irssi</a> is my current client of choice for a few reasons.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer" title="SASL">SASL</a>, among other things, is one thing that can be enabled to secure your communication on IRC. There's quite a bit of information out there already about how to <a href="https://freenode.net/sasl/sasl-irssi.shtml" title="Enabling SASL in irssi on Freenode">enable SASL for irssi on Freenode</a>. These instructions worked out of the box for me on Linux, but not on Mac OSX. After downloading <code>cap_sasl.pl</code> and putting it in <code>~/.irssi/scripts/autorun</code> and installing the required Perl modules I went through the steps to get SASL configured. When I attempted to enable it as per the instructions using the command <code>/sasl set network TheColonial &lt;password&gt; DH-BLOWFISH</code> I had the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p>Can't locate object method "send_raw_now" via package "Irssi::Irc::Server"</p></blockquote>

<p>This took a bit of Googling to nail. It turns out that, for some reason, on Mac OSX <code>irssi</code> actually requires an extra package to be included in the script. So open <code>cap_sasl.pl</code> and look for this (it's right at the top):</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use Irssi;
</code></pre>

<p>Immediately below this, add the following:</p>

<pre><code>use Irssi::Irc;
</code></pre>

<p>The script should now run fine and <code>irssi</code> should stop complaining.</p>

<p>This might seem obvious to some, but it wasn't to me! From what I can tell other people around the traps have had the same problem so I thought I'd post this in the hope that it helps others.</p>

    <id>http://buffered.io/posts/xss-flaws-via-mvc-model-binding-and-request.querystring-inconsistencies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Forgive the title of the post, it was hard coming up with something succinct that captured the purpose of the post. This was inspired by a recent experience with a client who had this exact problem with one of their production systems.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Never use [Request.QueryString][] to access parameters in your views, even when you're sure your actions have validated them. You may open your application up to [XSS][] attacks. Always, <em>always</em> use data that is passed to your views via the <code>Model</code> or the [ViewData][] dictionary. Under no circumstances should you trust data coming in from the web, that includes query string parameters.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Setting the scene</h2>

<p>The application provided a certain function which allowed users to browse information tied to a number of entities. For the sake of this discussion let's say those entities were instances of a <strong>Person</strong>. The number of entities was extremely small, so it was decided that the interface would consist of a drop-down box consisting of all the entities. When that drop-down box was used a <em>change</em> event would fire using JavaScript that would modify the current URL and render a new page. That page would show the same drop-down list, with the appropriate entry selected, along with the information specfic to that entity.</p>

<p>Let's see some code starting with the "details" of the person:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Person.cs  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">&gt;}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Nothing too amazing there. Here's the parts of the page which renders the list of people:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Index.aspx (partial)  </span></figcaption>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>Please choose a person <span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>%= Html.DropDownList(&quot;people&quot;, Model) %&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&lt;%= Url.Action(&quot;Detail&quot;, &quot;Person&quot;) %&gt;?index=&#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">val</span><span class="p">();</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Again, nothing too mind boggling here either. We can see how the <code>change</code> event fires and updates the <code>window.location</code> and moves the user to the <code>Details</code> page. The <code>Model</code> for this page is of type <code>IEnumerable&lt;SelectListItem&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Next we'll take a look at the controller action which gets invoked when the drop-down is changed:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>PersonController.cs (Partial)  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">View</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Detail&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Tuple</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">People</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">GetPeople</span><span class="p">()));</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="n">pre</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="p">&gt;}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>We're using the <code>index</code> parameter (note the <em>type</em> of this parameter, it's important) to index into the list of people we have stashed somewhere to extract the user that is being viewed. This person, along with the full list of people in <code>SelectListItem</code> form, is being passed to the view.</p>

<p>Let's see what the view does with this information:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

This is starting to get a bit more interesting. The rendering of the drop-down is the same as before, except it's pulling data from the [System.Tuple][] that was passed in as the `Model`. The event handler that's invoked on `change` is the same, and there's a bit of non-descript content rendering a the bottom. The subtle but important difference is the code that sets the currently selected person in the drop-down.

I plugged this code into a standard MVC application and this is what it looks like:

<img src="/uploads/2012/11/xss-index.png" title="'Choosing a person'" >

After selecting a person from the drop down it looks like this:

<img src="/uploads/2012/11/xss-details.png" title="'Person details'" >

A bad assumption
----------------

As you already know, ASP.NET MVC has the ability to automatically convert query string parameters into type-safe arguments that are passed into the controller actions. In the above example the `index` query string parameter is converted to an `int` and passed into the `Details` action. If a user attempts to modify this value to something that isn't an integer then MVC will literally poop itself, right?

Let's see.

<img src="/uploads/2012/11/xss-type-fail.png" title="'Person details'" >

OK, so MVC will require that this value be an integer, otherwise the action will fail to be invoked. If that's the case, then the view won't be rendered and our code which directly accesses `Request.QueryString` will not be invoked and hence there's no risk.

Right?

[Wrong][HPP].

The attack vector
-----------------

[HTTP Parameter Pollution][HPP] is a relatively "new" problem which revolves around the way that web servers/applications parse and handle multiple instances of the same GET/POST parameter. Phew!

In other words, if a malicious user decides to pass in _another_ instance of the `index` parameter in the query string, what happens? The way this is handled varies from technology to technology (see [slide 9][HPPPDF] for some examples), but here we're only interested in ASP.NET with IIS and MVC.

Let me just state this again: we're only interested in ASP.NET and IIS _**and MVC**_. The reason we need to emphasise this is because MVC rocks the boat a little bit. It's important to remember that [Request.QueryString][] is not specific to MVC, it's something that lives in ASP.NET land. _Controller actions_ on the other hand are not available across the board when using ASP.NET, they live in MVC land. When it comes to binding query string parameters to controller action method parameters, MVC doesn't behave how you would expect, and it's not the same as what happens when dealing with `Request.QueryString` directly.

So what happens in ASP.NET and IIS _without_ MVC if an attacker passes in two values for the same parameter? Consider the following url: `http://foo.com/bar?baz=0&baz=dooby`

While in C# land (remember, outside of MVC) `Request.QueryString["baz"]` will contain a string value `0,dooby`. In our current environment any duplicate instances of query string values are passed through as a single value joined together by commas. This knowledge is scarily uncommon. Many .NET developers that I know are not aware of this behaviour.

This is where MVC comes along and sprays poop over everything.

ASP.NET MVC controller action method parameter binding doesn't handle multiple instance of the same query string parameters in the same way. In fact, it behaves more like JSP on Jetty: **it only uses the first value and ignores the rest**.

Why is this bad? Well this means that code outside of controller actions may result in different behaviour to that which is inside. More importantly, accessing `Request.QueryString` to get access to a parameter doesn't mean that you'll get the same value as what was handled in the controller action.

Let's take a look at what might happen if we threw multiple instances via the query string at our dodgy MVC application:

<img src="/uploads/2012/11/xss-hpp-invalid.png" title="'HPP example'" >

The above screenshot shows both the query string and the page source when we do this. That's right, MVC used the first value, set to `0`, without any issues and invoked the view engine. The view's assumption that the `index` parameter has been sanitised by the controller has now been proven unsafe. Now we can see that we do have access to the source. Let's see what happens if we went a step further and passed in a more sinister value:

<img src="/uploads/2012/11/xss-hpp-valid.png" title="'HPP XSS exploit'" >

Pwned.

Conclusion
----------

_Never_ trust unsanitised input, that includes stuff that gets passed in through `Request.QueryString`. Do not assume that the contents are safe just because your controller action handled things without throwing an exception. If you're going to render data that has come in from the user or from the query string, delegate responsibility of validation to the controller action and only trust content which is passed to the view via [ViewData][] or the `Model`.

    <id>http://buffered.io/posts/websites-are-hard-to-build</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/uploads/2008/11/elope-harlequin-jester.jpg" title="'Uninformed client'" ></p>

<blockquote><p>"It's just a small site, how hard can it be?"</p>

<p>"I thought you could do it for me as a favour. It's not a complicated site."</p>

<p>"This would take me an afternoon, but I don't have time, can you do it for me?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Have you ever heard these comments before? Have you heard ones that are similar? I've been hearing them a lot in the last few weeks and it's starting to get to me.</p>

<p>I have just had a chat with a mate who is also suffering this pain, and that conversation is what inspired me to write this, the first random rant in a while.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Let me start by saying that <em>building software is <strong>hard</strong></em>. Building <em>quality</em> software is <strong>harder</strong>. I've been in the industry for 10 years now, and I can say with a certain level of confidence (and perhaps a little bit of authority) that it's harder than most people think -- particularly business users, clients and lots of family and friends.</p>

<p>Let me follow that on by saying that websites are software (no way!). That puts them in the "hard" basket. Every site, even if it's a static page with some simple content, comes with its own set of challenges -- and those challenges are rarely understood by anyone who hasn't experienced the pain of building software.</p>

<p>The point of this post it to give a little bit of exposure to some of these issues. I hope that this post gets read by those people who have plans to have some sort of software built but haven't really got a clue what's involved.</p>

<h2>Requirement Issues</h2>

<p>Let's be fair ... you don't know what you want. You <em>think</em> you do, but you really don't. You have an idea for something that will either make your life easier or "be really cool", but as far as actually <strong>thinking</strong> about how it would function ... ? You haven't done that at all.</p>

<p>Here lies the first of the big stumbling blocks. You want a website, because "everyone has a website these days" for almost everything. Started a new business? You must have a website! Released an album? You must have a website! Had a child? You must have a website! Never had a website? You must have a website!</p>

<p>Before you dive headlong into the quest to find the person to build the site for you, have a good long think about what it is you want that site to be. What is its purpose? What content is required? Will it be dynamic? Will it be static? Will it be data-driven and require a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" title="Content Management System">Content Management System</a>? Do you want other people to submit content? Do you want to have the facility available for readers to add their own comments? Will it be product driven and need the ability for people to buy stuff directly from the site? Do you need it to work on all browsers? Does it require access via a mobile phone or hand-held gadget?</p>

<p>These questions need to be answered well before any design is even contemplated, let alone structure and technical architecture. Do yourself and your site development team a favour. Think long and hard about what you want, and while you're doing that, ponder what possible issues you might face. The more issues you think of now, the cheaper it will be to build the site that fits your needs. Not just that, but you'll reduce the "scope on a rope" which results in the blowout of timelines and budgets.</p>

<h2>Design Issues</h2>

<p>We're coming to the end of 2008 and yet people still don't realise that development is <strong>not the same as design</strong>. Ask yourself the question: if design is part of development, then why do people make a living out of website design? The answer is simple: It's a big job, and it's very hard to do it right. I'm a developer, and I feel that there are very few (if any) areas of development that I couldn't work in, but I can tell you this for certain: I am <strong>not a designer</strong>. <a href="http://shiftperception.com/blog/" title="Shiftperception">Dan</a> will no doubt appreciate that.</p>

<p>It's true, I am not a designer. I can not design websites. I can do the technical desing, the architecture and the implementation. I can not do the design. Creating the right design for a website isn't an easy thing to do. I can tell you when people get it right, and I can tell you when people get it wrong, I just can't tell you why.</p>

<p>So, again, do yourself a favour. Get a proper web designer with a great portfolio of projects and go through the ideas you have with them. They will end up providing you an interface which makes sense for what you're trying to do. Do not fall into the trap of assuming that this part of the process isn't important. Yes, up front the cost most appear higher, but in the long run you will not regret it.</p>

<h2>Technical Issues</h2>

<p>Stumbling block number 3 is the lack of understanding of the technical issues. It's no surprise though, considering that most people wanting sites are not technical in nature. While it's fine for a client to not have (or want) an understanding of the technical issues, it's certainly <em>not</em> fine for them to ignore the fact that they even exist. Sticking your head in the sand and saying things like "well you'll figure it out" or "isn't that what I'm paying you for" doesn't really cut the mustard, particularly when you haven't thought about what you want in the first place.</p>

<p>When building websites there are all kinds of technical hurdles to leap over. To name a few...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Platform</strong> - I think most of the non-techie readers will have no clue of what I mean here. The platform is what the site runs on. That is, the operating system, the runtime, the software that supports it, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-browser compatibility</strong> - The biggest issue in any Internet-facing website is cross-browser issues. Not all browsers were made equally. Each and every one has its own set of quirks, and the people responsible for building the interface to the site need to cater for all these quirks. If they don't, then they may alienate a subset of potential readers which would do damage to the site's potential traffic and income. <strong>DO NOT</strong> underestimate how painful this can be. Yes, there are tools out there which apparently take care of these issues for you, but let me tell you that most of the time they fail too. Be prepared for a great deal of work to go into making your site look and behave on the same on a variety of browsers. As a small side-note, some browsers actually behave differently on, say, Windows compared to how they would on, say, Mac OSX.</li>
<li><strong>Secure payments</strong> - Sounds easy right? "I just want the ability for people to enter credit card details and pay for stuff." Unfortunately it isn't that simple. You have all kinds of issues to worry about if you want that to happen directly in your site. You have to set up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" title="Transport layer security">SSL</a>, you have to arrange for a proper payment portal to site behind your site and handle the requests. You need to make sure your site is set up in such a way that any malicious users can not buy stuff without paying, nor have honest users' information compromised and shared. There are other options, such as <a href="http://www.paypal.com/" title="PayPal">PayPal</a> and <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/index.htm" title="Amazon Payments">Amazon</a>, but these facilities operate externally and won't appear "incorporated" in the site.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - You've done well if you already know what this is. In short, it refers to your sites ability to be read by people who are visually impaired who use devices such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader" title="Screen reader">screen readers</a>. If you want your site to be fully accessible, then expect a great deal more effort to be involved. Your site needs to be structured in a special way and it needs to be <strong>fully</strong> compliant with a markup standard (such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/loosedtd.html" title="HTML 4.0">HTML 4.0 Transitional</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong> - This issue comes with a stack of other issues that most people don't even think about (sometimes even developers!). Do you have your own host? Do you have a shared host? Dedicated host? Do you need it in your own country? Do you need Windows or Linux? Do you need email facilities? Do you need SSL? Do you need a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network" title="Content delivery network">CDN</a>? Choosing a location for your site is affected by so many things. For example, if you're looking for a fully secure site which keeps track of user details and sensitive information (such as credit cards) then a shared hosting solution is an <em>EPIC FAIL</em>. In case the reason isn't obvious I'll tell you. If you use a shared host, then the entire machine is only as secure as the weakest account. If another site, owned by someone else, is compromised then the attacker owns the box which contains YOUR sites as well.</li>
<li><strong>Database</strong> - This isn't just about which one to use. It's about how to use it. Databases are underestimated and often misunderstood. It's <em>very</em> easy to do databases wrong. This is a real kicker for those applications that are very database heavy. In particular, applications which require complex relationships and/or deep searching capabilities. If your application relies on an insanely speedy, distributed database or is search-heavy, you had best get yourself a DB guru ... and be prepared to pay for them! A recent example with some interested details was recently posted on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/sql-2008-full-text-search-problems/" title="SQL 2008 Full Text Search Problems">StackOverflow</a>, go have a read!</li>
<li><strong>Traffic</strong> - If you're aiming to build a site that isn't going to be used often or doesn't have a great deal of content, then this might not be so much of an issue. But if you have a site that is going to be bombarded with traffic, don't expect your first cut of your system to, er, cut it. I once heard a semi-famous man say "<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000957.html" title="Everything is fast for small n">Everything is fast for small <em>n</em>"</a>, and he's dead right. In development and testing, your app will probably fly. But under load, with thousands of people hitting it at the same time, it may just keel over and die. Be prepared to face this problem in the development stage.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong> - I left this one last because it's a little verbose and somewhat random. So many things can affect the maintainability of the site. The main problem here though is that in general, the idea of maintenance after a site has been developed is far from anyone's thoughts. Maintenance is where you'll spend most of your cash long term. Minimising the potential issues during development really is key to making a site which isn't going to cost the earth to maintain or enhance. The most common cause of highly unmaintainable websites is "Little Johnny" (LJ). LJ is the bloke that someone knows through a friend of a friend, or through the family. He's the guy who "knows stuff about computers". Of course, that means that he can &lt;sarcasm&gt;build commercial websites that are flexible, secure, fast, extendible, easy to maintain and that WORK&lt;/sarcasm&gt;. In all seriousness, you might know someone who knows something about computers, but if you're serious about your site, then get someone who knows what they're doing. You'll pay more in the long run for someone who doesn't. Either that, or take one of your employees, and put them through a course so that they can learn how it's done. To sum up, if you want to reduce the cost of maintenance there is a lot of work involved, and your developers need to know what they're doing. Be prepared for a lot of work in this area.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Testing Issues</h2>

<p>Testing? What's that?</p>

<p>It's frightening that even in Enterprise software, testing is generally an afterthought. Recently I was fortunate enough to be part of a team where testing was a huge part of the development process. It was <em>really</em> good and the result was a seriously higher quality application.</p>

<p>Developers do not know how to test their own code properly. Sure, they can write unit tests, and they do some form of manual functional testing on a daily basis while they're building the software. This is <strong>not</strong> the same as having a full test plan and suite of tests to verify the quality of the application.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favour, spend some of your budget and get some testers in. They will put your application/site through its paces instead of your users!</p>

<h2>Deployment Issues</h2>

<p>Once you've worked with a development team, you'll become very familiar with the following phrase:</p>

<blockquote><p>It works on my machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's something that you'll hear constantly. I'll admit to saying it on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The point here is that it is very common for things to work in the development environment, but end up breaking when deployed to a production environment. Deployment is another often overlooked area of the process. When it <em>is</em> considered, it's underestimated.</p>

<p>Be careful. Here be dragons. Before you get stuck, speak to someone who <a href="http://johnmcfadyen.spaces.live.com/" title="John Mcfadyen's Windows Installer blog">knows what they're doing</a>.</p>

<h2>Support Issues</h2>

<p>So you've managed to ship your application. It's online, it's deployed and it's running. But something goes wrong. The site breaks every now and then. Users are having issues with the payment portal. People using Firefox on Mac OSX can't sign in. Reports are coming back with incorrect values.</p>

<p>Do you have a plan in place to handle these requests? Do you have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugtracker" title="Bug tracker">bug tracking system</a>? Do you have a support team ready to handle requests? Have you kept any of the development team on board to help you with the support issues?</p>

<p>Generally, the answer to all of these questions is <em>no</em>. My advice would be to make it a <em>yes</em>. Put a plan in place to help you with the teething issues once you've gone live. Trust me, there <em>will</em> be issues.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope that the target audience have a little more visibility of the issues that are faced when building websites (and software in general). I hope that they learn from it and take some of the advice and do proper preparation before undertaking a development project.</p>

<p>Finally, I really do hope that it stops some of you from coming out with the comments listed at the start of this post.</p>

<p>As always, feedback and comments are welcomed and appreciated. Cheers!</p>

    <link href="http://buffered.io/posts/opendns-is-wicked/"/>
    <updated>2008-08-18T22:03:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://buffered.io/posts/opendns-is-wicked</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a title="Use OpenDNS to make your Internet faster, safer, and smarter." href="http://www.opendns.com/share/"><img src="http://images.opendns.com/buttons/use_opendns_155x52.gif" width="155" height="52" style="border:0; float:right; margin-left:5px;margin-bottom;5px" alt="Use OpenDNS" /></a>Over the last couple of weeks the DNS timeouts and lags I've been experiencing at home have made the web experience a little dire. My <a href="http://internode.on.net/" title="Internode">ISP</a> is actually pretty darned good, but for some reason they seem to have glitches with their DNS servers every now and then.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The last time it happened I wasn't able to get <em>any</em> sites to respond. I ended up popping some manual DNS server entries into my router which I had archived in a "welcome" email that I had received when I first signed up for my Internet account. These worked well for a while, but eventually ended up going offline and so I had to look for another option.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://opendns.org/" title="OpenDNS">OpenDNS</a>. A free DNS service with a stack of features that anyone can use. I'll go over a few of them.</p>

<p>First up is <strong>Content filtering</strong>. What a fab idea! Offsite content filtering that stops dodgey and unwanted stuff before it even hits your modem. OpenDNS supports content filtering in a couple of ways which makes it really easy to generally filter out particular sites and content.</p>

<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_content_filtering_levels.png"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_content_filtering_levels.png" alt="Content Filtering" title="Content Filtering" width="150" style="float:left; margin-right:5px; margin-bottom:5px;" rel="lightbox[opendns]" /></a>The content filtering mechanism is quite extensive. You have the option of choosing a predefined "filtering level", each of which defines a set of site categories which will be filtered out for viewers on your network. The options go from <em>Minimal</em>, which simply blocks known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing" title="Phishing">phishing</a> sites, through to <em>High</em> which covers everything from porn and illegal activities to video sharing sites.</p>

<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_content_filtering_custom.png"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_content_filtering_custom.png" alt="Custom Content Filtering" title="Custom Content Filtering" width="150" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-bottom:5px;" rel="lightbox[opendns]" /></a>There is also a <em>Custom</em> level which allows you to choose the categories that you want filtered. This is the long-hand version of the predefined levels mentioned above, which is great as it let's you pick and choose if you want finger-grained control.</p>

<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_site_block.png"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_site_block.png" alt="Site Blocking" title="Site Blocking" width="150" style="float:left; margin-right:5px; margin-bottom:5px;" rel="lightbox[opendns]" /></a>Lastly, as far as filtering goes, you have the option of allowing or blocking sites as a hard rule. This is handy if you know that a particular site is getting caught in your filter but you know for sure that it's safe. This happens surprisingly often, so having a whitelist is very handy. Being able to block a stack of ad sites before they even hit your browser is also a winner, hence the blacklist feature is great too.</p>

<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_client.png"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_client.png" alt="OpenDNS Client" title="OpenDNS Client" width="150" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-bottom:5px;" rel="lightbox[opendns]" /></a>Thankfully OpenDNS supports <strong>IP address auto-update</strong>. Over time, you'll no doubt get different IP addresses from your ISP as your DHCP leases expire or when you reconnect your modem to your service. Given that OpenDNS needs to have some way of determining who you are, IP address really is the only way. So to help keep OpenDNS up-to-date with your current IP (and hence, keep applying your filtering rules), there is a client application that you can have running in your system tray which contacts the service periodically and makes sure that it has the latest IP. While this is a great idea it's a bit crap that you have to run a client application. It's a shame that they didn't decide to support the use of another dynamic addressing system such as <a href="http://dyndns.org/" title="DynDns">DynDns.org</a> (lots of modems have built-in support for updating services like DynDns automatically).</p>

<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_customisation.png"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_customisation.png" alt="Customisation" title="Customisation" width="150" style="float:left; margin-right:5px; margin-bottom:5px;" rel="lightbox[opendns]" /></a>For those who like to make their services feel cosey, OpenDNS supports <strong>customisation</strong> of various bits of functionality. For example, you're able to change the logo picture (this is more of an interest to site admins). You can also modify messages that are displayed when sites are blocked for various reasons. For those of you on home networks, specifying more meaningful messages for those, shall we say, "less technical" family members will no doubt be beneficial in reducing the number of support calls.</p>

<p><a href="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_shortcuts.png"><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/08/opendns_shortcuts.png" alt="Shortcuts" title="Shortcuts" width="150" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-bottom:5px;" rel="lightbox[opendns]" /></a><strong>Network shortcuts</strong> are another nifty feature. A network shortcut is essentially a bookmark which works across the entire network. All you have to do is specify a name for your shortcut, and the site that it redirects to, and you're done. Once the shortcut has been saved, all you have to do to get to the site is type in the name of the shortcut. When the DNS request is made, OpenDNS looks for any shortcuts by that name that exist in your list, and if found, it will redirect the user to the appropriate site. Groovey!</p>

<p>At first you don't believe it, but OpenDNS is <strong>surprisingly quick</strong>. I wouldn't say that I have conducted a huge set of performance tests and benchmarks, but I would say that it by far outperforms my ISP's DNS servers as far as responsivity is concerned. Not just that, but <strong>it works</strong>. I am yet to see a DNS lookup fail requiring me to retry.</p>

<p>The final redeeming feature of OpenDNS is that it's constantly updated and secure. <a href="http://www.doxpara.com/?p=1185">Flaws in the DNS system</a>, for example, have already been patched. This reduces the chances of you dealing with an insecure DNS server (such as the one sitting at your ISP) and ending up at a site that might be a little unsavoury.</p>

<p>To sum up, I really think OpenDNS is a great service. It's fast, feature-rich and very handy. For anyone with a family/kids or a need/desire to filter out some of the f**ked up content that lives on the web (such as this site ;)), this service is for you. Give it a spin!</p>

    <link href="http://buffered.io/posts/net-fu-signing-an-unsigned-assembly-without-delay-signing/"/>
    <updated>2008-07-09T12:13:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://buffered.io/posts/net-fu-signing-an-unsigned-assembly-without-delay-signing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article is also available in <a href="http://www.otherbit.com/modules/blog/BlogContent.aspx?ID=174" title=".NET-FU : come trasformare in SIGNED un assembly UNSIGNED (senza ricorrere al DELAY SIGNING)">Italian</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The code-base that I am currently working with consists of a large set of binaries that are all <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xc31ft41.aspx" title="Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name">signed</a>. The savvy .NET devs out there will know that any assembly that's used/referenced by a signed assembly must <em>also</em> be signed.</p>

<p>This is an issue when dealing with third-party libraries that are not signed. Sometimes you'll be lucky enough to be dealing with vendor that is happy to provide a set of signed assemblies, other times you won't. If your scenario fits the latter (as a recent one did for my colleagues and I), you need to sign the assemblies yourself. Here's how.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><em>Note:</em> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t07a3dye(VS.80).aspx" title="Delay Signing an Assembly">delay signing</a> is not covered in this article.</p>

<h2>Scenario 1 - Foo and Bar</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>Foo</code> is the component that you're building which has to be signed.</li>
<li><code>Bar</code> is the third-party component that you're forced to use that <em>isn't</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/07/foobar.png" alt="Relationship between Foo and Bar" /></p>

<p>Grab <a href="/uploads/2008/07/bar.zip" title="Project/Binary for Bar">Bar.dll and project</a> along with <a href="/uploads/2008/07/foobar.zip" title="Project/Binary for Foo">Foo.dll and project</a> to see a source sample.</p>

<p>You'll notice <em>Foo</em> has a .snk which is used to sign <em>Foo.dll.</em> When you attempt to compile <em>Foo</em> you get the following error message:</p>

<blockquote><p>Assembly generation failed -- Referenced assembly 'Bar' does not have a strong name.</p></blockquote>

<p>We need to sign <em>Bar</em> in order for <em>Foo</em> to compile.</p>

<p><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/07/step1.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 2px;" alt="Disassemble Bar" /></p>

<h3>Step 1 - Disassemble Bar</h3>

<p>We need to open a command prompt which has the .NET framework binaries in the PATH environment variable. The easiest way to do this is to open a Visual Studio command prompt (which is usually under the "Visual Studio Tools" subfolder of "Visual Studio 20XX" in your programs menu). Change directory so that you're in the folder which contains <em>Bar.dll</em>.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f7dy01k1(VS.80).aspx" title="MSIL Disassembly">ildasm</a> to disassemble the file using the <code>/all</code> and <code>/out</code>, like so:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Foo\bin&gt; ildasm /all /out=Bar.il Bar.dll
</code></pre>

<p>The result of the command is a new file, <em>Bar.il</em>, which contains a dissassembled listing of <em>Bar.dll</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/07/step2.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 2px;" alt="Rebuild and Sign Bar" /></p>

<h3>Step 2 - Rebuild and Sign Bar</h3>

<p>We can now use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/496e4ekx.aspx" title="MSIL Assembler">ilasm</a> to reassemble <em>Bar.il</em> back into <em>Bar.dll</em>, but at the same time specify a strong-name key to use to sign the resulting assembly. We pass in the value <em>Foo.snk</em> to the <code>/key</code> switch on the command line, like so:</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>


<pre><code>C:\Foo\bin&gt; ilasm /dll /key=Foo.snk Bar.il

Microsoft (R) .NET Framework IL Assembler.  Version 2.0.50727.1434
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

</code></pre>

<p><em>Bar.dll</em> is now signed! All we have to do is reopen <em>Foo</em>'s project, remove the reference to <em>Bar.dll</em>, re-add the reference to the new signed assembly and rebuild. Sorted!</p>

<h2>Scenario 2 - Foo, Bar and Baz</h2>

<ul>
<li><code>Foo</code> is the component that you're building which has to be signed.</li>
<li><code>Bar</code> is the third-party component that you're forced to use that <em>isn't</em>.</li>
<li><code>Baz</code> is another third-party component that is required in order for you to use <em>Bar</em>.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/07/foobarbaz.png" alt="Relationship between Foo, Bar and Baz"/></p>

<p>Grab <a href="/uploads/2008/07/baz.zip" title="Project/Binary for Baz"><em>Baz.dll</em> and project</a>, <a href="/uploads/2008/07/barbaz.zip" title="Project/Binary for Bar"><em>Bar.dll</em> and project</a> along with <a href="/uploads/2008/07/foobarbaz.zip" title="Project/Binary for Foo"><em>Foo.dll</em> and project</a> for a sample source.</p>

<p>When you attempt to build <em>Foo</em> you get the same error as you do in the previous scenario. Bear in mind that this time, <strong>both</strong> <em>Bar.dll</em> and <em>Baz.dll</em> need to be signed. So first of all, follow the steps in <strong>Scenario 1</strong> for both <em>Bar.dll</em> and <em>Baz.dll</em>.</p>

<p>Done? OK. When you attempt to build <em>Foo.dll</em> after pointing the project at the new <em>Bar.dll</em> no compiler errors will be shown. Don't get too excited :)</p>

<p>When you attempt to <strong>use</strong> <em>Foo.dll</em> your world will come crashing down. The reason is because <em>Bar.dll</em> was originally built with a reference to an <u>unsigned version</u> of <em>Baz.dll</em>. Now that <em>Baz.dll</em> is signed we need to force <em>Bar.dll</em> to reference the <strong>signed</strong> version of <em>Baz.dll</em>.</p>

<p><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/07/step3.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 2px;" alt="Hack the Disassembled IL" /></p>

<h3>Step 1 - Hack the Disassembled IL</h3>

<p>Just like we did in the previous steps we need to disassemble the binary that we need to fix. This time, make sure you disassemble the new binary that you created in the previous step (this binary has been signed, and will contain the signature block for the strong name). Once <em>Bar.il</em> has been created using ildasm, open it up in a <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="VIM - @secretGeek loves it... no really, he does!">text editor</a>.</p>

<p>Search for the reference to <em>Baz</em> -- this should be located a fair way down the file, somewhere near the top of the actual code listing, just after the comments. Here's what it looks like on my machine:</p>

<pre><code>.assembly extern /*23000002*/ Baz
{
  .ver 1:0:0:0
}
</code></pre>

<p>This external assembly reference is missing the all-important public key token reference. Before we can add it, we need to know what the public key token is for <em>Bar.dll</em>. To determine this, we can use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k5b5tt23(VS.80).aspx" title="Strong Name Tool">sn.exe</a> utility, like so:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Foo\bin&gt; sn -Tp Baz.dll

Microsoft (R) .NET Framework Strong Name Utility  Version 3.5.21022.8
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

Public key is
0024000004800000940000000602000000240000525341310004000001000100a59cd85e10658d
9229d54de16c69d0b53b31f60bb4404b86eb3b8804203aca9d65412a249dfb8e7b9869d09ce80b
0d9bdccd4943c0004c4e76b95fdcdbc6043765f51a1ee331fdd55ad25400d496808b792723fc76
dee74d3db67403572cddd530cadfa7fbdd974cef7700be93c00c81121d978a3398b07a9dc1077f
b331ca9c

Public key token is 2ed7bbec811020ec
</code></pre>

<p>Now we return to <em>Bar.il</em> and modify the assembly reference so that the public key token is specified. This is what it should look like after modification:</p>

<pre><code>.assembly extern /*23000002*/ Baz
{
  .publickeytoken = (2E D7 BB EC 81 10 20 EC )
  .ver 1:0:0:0
}
</code></pre>

<p>Save your changes.</p>

<p><img src="http://buffered.io/uploads/2008/07/step4.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 2px;" alt="Reassemble Bar" /></p>

<h3>Step 2 - Reassemble Bar</h3>

<p>This step is just a repeat of previous steps. We are again using ilasm to reassemble <em>Bar.dll</em>, but this time from the new "hacked" <em>Bar.il</em> file. We must use the exact same command line as we did previously, and we still need to specify the <em>Foo.snk</em> for signing the assembly. To save you having to scroll up, here it is again:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Foo\bin&gt; ilasm /dll /key=Foo.snk Bar.il

Microsoft (R) .NET Framework IL Assembler.  Version 2.0.50727.1434
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

Class 1 Props: 1;
Resolving local member refs: 0 -&gt; 0 defs, 0 refs, 0 unresolved
Writing PE file
Signing file with strong name
Operation completed successfully
</code></pre>

<p>Open up <em>Foo</em>'s project, remove and re-add the reference to <em>Bar.dll</em>, making sure you point to the new version that you just created. <em>Foo.dll</em> will not only build, but this time it will run!</p>
