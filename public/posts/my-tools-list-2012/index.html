<div class="entry-content"><p>The topic of tools is often a hot one amongst developers and every year
we see an influx of blog posts where people rant and rave about which
ones they love the most, and why.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to stay out of such a discussion!</p>

<p>Here is a list of the tools that I use as of the end of January 2012. Some are simply noteworthy.
Others are very handy and while I would get by without them they would
be missed. Some of these <strong>I simply cannot live without</strong>. I&rsquo;m not going
to bother with ratings. I won&rsquo;t go into frameworks or the like which
make their way into my code, instead I am focussing on those tools which
help me do the coding and which aid me in my general computer usage.</p>

<p>Some of these tools are platform-specific, but many can be used across
different platforms.</p>

<h2>VIM</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/">Bram Moolenaar</a> &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org/</a></p>

<p>Yes I&rsquo;m getting the religious war out of the way immediately.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, your editor is the most important tool in your toolbox.
If you haven&rsquo;t yet mastered your own editor you are seriously doing
yourself a disservice. For me, VIM is by far the best editor I have ever
used. Why? Well&hellip;</p>

<p>When it comes to coding I spend most of my <em>editing</em> code rather than
writing it. That could be because I&rsquo;m a terrible code, it could be
that coding is mostly editing with a bit of straight, rawhide
development along the way. As a result I find that the most common
things that I do when coding are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moving around the source files.</li>
<li>Searching for text.</li>
<li>Repeating edits that are the same or similar.</li>
<li>As much as I hate to say it, cutting and pasting (think &ldquo;moving code
around&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;duplicating code&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Performing edits of a very specific coding nature. Examples are
replacing a function&rsquo;s argument list, deleting the content of
a function, renaming, refactoring, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think that many other developers will have similar experiences.</p>

<p>The first question I get when I start to explain my position is:
<em>&ldquo;So why is it that you prefer to use VIM for this when there are so
many tools out there that can help you do all of the above?&rdquo;</em> More often
that not this comes from the .NET developers I know. These guys know
that I spend most of my time (at least at the moment) writing .NET
applications. As a result, I spend a lot of time in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/">Visual Studio</a>.</p>

<p>So if I have Visual Studio handy I also have a plethora of plug-ins, such
as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/rsharper">ReSharper</a>, which can help with refactoring, moving code around,
etc. Why not use them? The answer is pretty simple: I don&rsquo;t want to tie
myself to a tool (or set of tools) that is tied to one language or
platform.</p>

<p>I love to code in other languages such as <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp">F#</a>. I have
no choice but to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> but I also use <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a>
and have played with the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> and <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>. I use these
languages on <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/">three</a> <a href="http://kernel.org/">different</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">platforms</a>.</p>

<p>I want the same editing experience, the same shortcuts, the same layout
and the same colour scheme regardless of language or platform. Visual
Studio can not give me that (nor will it down the track).</p>

<p>As well as this, the likes of Visual Studio and ReSharper tend to cost
a fair bit of cash. VIM does not, it&rsquo;s free.</p>

<p>I could have chosen one of a number of editors &mdash; including <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs">Emacs</a>,
<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a> and more &mdash; but after
experimenting with each and every one, VIM was a standout performer
thanks to&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Command mode</strong> &ndash; having the ability to <em>remain in command mode</em> without
the need to hold a modifier key (such as CTRL) is brilliant. It feels
much friendlier on the hands and does a great job of reducing strain and
the likelihood of RSI. You can do way more with fewer keystrokes and
often you don&rsquo;t even have to move your fingers from the home row.</p>

<p>A common argument against VIM is the learning curve. Yes, it might
initially feel very odd and you will no doubt feel <em>less</em> productive
when you first start using it. After a surprisingly short period of
time, you will start to see the benefits and you&rsquo;ll wonder why you
haven&rsquo;t invested the time to learn this earlier.</p>

<p>VIM is also incredibly extensible. There are a ridiculous number of
[plug-ins and scripts][VimPlugins] available which do all kinds of crazy
things. There are syntax-highlighters for almost any language you can
think of, way too many to list here in full. I would like to mention
a few stand-outs. They are <a href="https://github.com/tpope/pathogen">Pathogen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-easymotion">EasyMotion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree">NERDTree</a>,
<a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t">CommandT</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3619">BufferGator</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Fugitive</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ervandew/supertab">SuperTab</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">Surround</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim">SnipMate</a>, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1234">Yankring</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat">Repeat</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also recently found out about the <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> setup (thanks <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/">Dan</a>) which provides
many of these plug-ins out of the box in a handy-to-use script. It
doesn&rsquo;t work too well on windows, and there&rsquo;s a bit of effort to get it
to work, but it&rsquo;s worth it. It even brings to the table many of the
plug-ins that I have listed above without the need to go and install them
separately.</p>

<p>To be frank, anyone who is serious about writing code should be using an
editor like this. If not VIM, then look at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs">Emacs</a>, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> or
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">SublimeText</a> as they are great contenders. But if you can stick at it
long enough, I think you&rsquo;ll find the rewards of using VIM are much
better than you would otherwise believe.</p>

<p>There, I&rsquo;ve said my piece. Time to move on!</p>

<h2>ViEmu</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://jonbho.net/">Jon Beltran de Heredia</a> &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://www.viemu.com/">http://www.viemu.com/</a></p>

<p>Wait a minute, didn&rsquo;t we just finish the VIM section? Yes we did, but
this tool, while related, is worth a mention by itself. ViEmu is
a plug-in for Visual Studio that makes the editor behave <em>like</em> VIM.
Unfortunately, due to a few reasons including the constraints put in
place by Visual Studio, it isn&rsquo;t a complete implementation of VIM.
Despite this, it&rsquo;s well worth paying for. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly go back to
using Visual Studio without it.</p>

<p>There is an alternative, <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329">VsVim</a>, which is free but it doesn&rsquo;t have
the command coverage that ViEmu does, nor does it perform as well in
many cases. It&rsquo;s enough to get you going, but if you&rsquo;re serious about
your VIMming in Visual Studio then get yourself a copy of ViEmu.</p>

<h2>UnxUtils</h2>

<p>Author: Not sure! &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/</a></p>

<p>UnxUtils is just a set of Win32 ports of the GNU tools. I can&rsquo;t do
without
the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">awk</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Which_(Unix)">which</a> etc from the command
line, nor can I bear using the likes of <code>dir</code> instead of <code>ls</code>. While
Windows does come with a subset of these (often with different names)
they aren&rsquo;t as easy to use nor do they have the coverage that you get
with the tools that come with *nix distributions.</p>

<p>On a new system I always download these and put them in my <code>%PATH%</code>.
Very handy!</p>

<h2>Mercurial</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/mpm">Matt Mackall</a> and others &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://hg-scm.org/">http://hg-scm.org/</a></p>

<p>This was the first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> that I was exposed to and I still love it.
It&rsquo;s a fantastic version control system and one that I often use for my
own projects. Mercurial is one of those tools that many people use,
particularly in the Open Source community.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend downloading and install the command-line client and
nothing more. The GUI tools are &ldquo;nice&rdquo;, but they&rsquo;re slow, and nowhere
near as easy to use as the CLI. Get used to the CLI and you&rsquo;ll be amazed
and how fast you can get things done.</p>

<p>If you use Open Source tools, you&rsquo;ll find that this is an absolute must
along with &hellip;</p>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com">Linus Torvalds</a> and others &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://git-scm.org/">http://git-scm.org/</a></p>

<p>As a long-term Mercurial user I found myself wondering why I would
bother using Git. Over time it became clear to me that learning it was
important. It has fast become the de-facto DVCS and I think this is
largely because of <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>Git&rsquo;s command-line is a bit esoteric but incredibly powerful.
Mercurial&rsquo;s is probably a bit more intuitive to use and easier to
digest, particularly if you&rsquo;re used to using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. To show
a crass example of how one can perceive the difference between the two,
here&rsquo;s an example (made up) of how you may make a cappuccino:</p>

<pre><code># with git
git drink --hot --infusion=coffee-beans --with-grind --milk=frothed --no-sugar

# with hg
hg cappuccino
</code></pre>

<p>I hope you get the point. Git is really powerful and super-configurable.
Mercurial is intuitive and easily covers most common use-cases with
commands that make sense.</p>

<p>Git&rsquo;s branching model is a bit different to that of Mercurial, and I have to
admit that I prefer it. Git is now my DVCS of choice, though this
wouldn&rsquo;t have been the case in the early days thanks to the woeful
Windows support.</p>

<p>Git, like Mercurial, is so common amongst Open Source enthusiasts that
you really don&rsquo;t have a choice but to install it. It&rsquo;s certainly worth
having and using. If you&rsquo;re building any application, even if it&rsquo;s
a small home project, you should be using a DVCS like Git.</p>

<h2>Rebar</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://twitter.com/dizzyco">Dave Smith</a> from <a href="http://www.basho.com/">Basho</a> &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="https://github.com/basho/rebar">https://github.com/basho/rebar</a></p>

<p>This is by far the best tool in my <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> box. It&rsquo;s a fast Erlang
build tool with some great options, such as file generation from
templates, running of unit tests and management of dependencies. It&rsquo;s
Open Source too!</p>

<p>Get it. Use it.</p>

<h2>Dropbox</h2>

<p>Homepage: <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">http://www.dropbox.com/</a></p>

<p>I think this is another really common developer tool, but can easily be
used by people who aren&rsquo;t developers. For me, this tool has its worth in
the ease in which files just magically appear on all the machines which
you use. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m too different from other developers in that
I have quite a few machines around the house that I use frequently. I am
also on-site with clients and often want access to certain things that
I don&rsquo;t want to share out on the open web with the rest of the world.
Dropbox is awesome for this.</p>

<p>I recently discovered another contender called <a href="https://www.insynchq.com/">InSync</a> which uses
<a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> as a backing store, but for me it doesn&rsquo;t quite have the
appeal of Dropbox.</p>

<p>Cross platform. Quick. Easy. Free for 2GB of space. Very cool.</p>

<h2>WinRAR</h2>

<p>Homepage: <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">http://www.rarlab.com/</a></p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, I paid for WinRAR and I love it. It&rsquo;s still my
archiver of choice after many years of use. It&rsquo;s easy, has great
integration with the Windows shell, and RAR compression is really quite
good.</p>

<p>Yes, there are other options out there now that are free and handle all
kinds of compression algorithms &mdash; <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a> is the first that comes to
mind &mdash; but I find that I like the way I can interact with WinRAR both
graphically and via the command-line. I have no reason nor desire to
move away from WinRAR. I highly recommend it.</p>

<h2>Diffmerge</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">Sourcegear</a> &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html</a></p>

<p>This is a free-to-use diff and merge tool. It works on Windows, Mac and
Linux and does a fantastic job of understanding the differences in
files. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that a tool this good can be free.</p>

<p>Many people continue to pay for and use <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/">BeyondCompare</a> but I can&rsquo;t
see any reason to move away from Diffmerge. If you&rsquo;re looking for
a great tool to help understand the changes in your code-base, look no
further!</p>

<h2>Alfred</h2>

<p>Homepage: <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">http://www.alfredapp.com/</a></p>

<p>Alfred is a simple productivity tool for Mac OSX. It&rsquo;s a combined
application launcher, file finder, application automation tool and web
integrator. Think <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a> on steroids and add a nicer UI.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s free and it&rsquo;s really good. You can also pay for a <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">Powerpack</a> that
gives you even more functionality for the tidy sub of just &pound;15.</p>

<h2>ttytter</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/">Cameron Kaiser</a> &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/">http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/</a></p>

<p>No it&rsquo;s not a development tool, but my life of coding is influenced by
those who I speak to on Twitter, and hence the tools that I use to
interact with it are worth a mention.</p>

<p>This is another great tool for the command-line monkeys. ttytter is a fully
functional Twitter client that runs in the console. It supports hashtag
searches, @mentions, direct messages with full colour-coding. It&rsquo;s
really easy to use and a greatly way to keep the noise down in your
Twitter feed. You can even filter out crap that you don&rsquo;t want to see.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great tool (written in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>!), but doesn&rsquo;t work in Windows.</p>

<h2>KeePassX</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=166631">KeePassX team</a> &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://www.keepassx.org/">http://www.keepassx.org/</a></p>

<p>Hands up if you have thousands of accounts across the Internet. Keep you
hands up if you often (or always) use the same password for all of those
things.</p>

<p>If you still have you hand up, you need a slap. Password management is
actually quite a serious issue. Using the same password on many accounts
can open to you up to all kinds of attacks from the naughty people. All
it takes it for one of your accounts to be compromised and your password
extracted. The rest of your accounts are now owned.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that the site you&rsquo;re signing up for uses the likes
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">SSL</a> or behind the scenes is doing a good job of managing your
password. To protect yourself you should instead generate large
passwords, ones that you don&rsquo;t have a hope of remembering, ones that
attackers will need quantum computers to crack. Also, having different
passwords to each of your accounts means that if one is compromised the
rest of them are still safe.</p>

<p>I use KeePassX to generate and manage these passwords. I secure my
password file with a brutally long password that I have no problems remembering.
This file is synced across my machines using
Dropbox so that I have access to my passwords wherever and whenever I need it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great utility and serves me really well. Get serious about your
password management and use something like KeePassX to help you do it.</p>

<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p>Author: <a href="http://brandonmathis.com/">Brandon Mathis</a> &mdash;
Homepage: <a href="http://octopress.org/">http://octopress.org/</a></p>

<p>This is what I use to write and publish my <a href="http://buffered.io/">blog</a>.
Previous I had used <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and had moved on to <a href="http://www.blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a> at
some point last year.</p>

<p>What I had realised was that my workflow for blogging wasn&rsquo;t really one
that fit with the likes of the mainstream tools like Wordpress. The
editing experience was painful, amongst other things. I came to realise
that a blog is in fact a static site with a few comments. Thanks to
<a href="http://www.disqus.com/">Disqus</a> the comment problem has been outsourced, so really the only
content I had was static. This is a good thing as handling static sites
is not only easier, but it means the server does less work and is less
likely to be attackable.</p>

<p>I moved over to Octopress over the holiday period of 2011/2012 and so
far I love it. I write all my posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, I push changes to
a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> repository and I publish a new version of my site with
a single command. It&rsquo;s a joy.</p>

<p>Octopress makes this all really easy and has built-in support for
themes, Github Pages and has a bunch of plug-ins that give you a great
looking and highly functional site out of the box.</p>

<p>I highly recommend it.</p>

<h1>That&rsquo;s all!</h1>

<p>Look at this list it&rsquo;s clear that I don&rsquo;t really rely on much. That
which I do rely on is often free or relatively low-cost. These tools are
what make me feel really productive and comfortable in front of the
machine. I hope that this has in some way inspired you to try a few new
things out, or at least write your own mini-list to praise that which
makes you the developer you are.</p>

<p>Bring on the comments, suggestions and flames.</p>
