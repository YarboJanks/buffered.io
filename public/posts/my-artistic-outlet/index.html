<div class="entry-content"><p>Most people who trundle through life, battling against the elements and working hard to achieve at work or in the home find that they need an escape. I&#8217;m not talking about just a holiday to the <a href="http://www.whitsundaytourism.com/" title="Whitsundays">Whitsundays</a> or a month off to go hiking in the Himalayas. I&#8217;m talking about something more regular. Something that perhaps you can do on a daily basis to help you feel more relaxed.</p>

<p>I have a few. I like to do distance running. At the moment my training regime is almost non-existant because of the stuff that&#8217;s going on, but that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to remedy shortly. I&#8217;m going to go for runs during lunchtimes again now that I&#8217;m somewhere which has a clean shower! I find that a good long run can really make me feel good. Nothing like a bit of cardio excercise followed by a hit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphin" title="Endorphin">endorphins</a>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I also play indoor soccer, but that&#8217;s going to have to stop due to cost. It&#8217;s a bit of a shame, but with the kind of things that are starting to take hold of life (<em>cough</em> <strong>mortgages</strong> <em>cough</em>), I&#8217;m going to have to tighten the belt a bit and indoor soccer is on the list of things to go.</p>

<p>But the one that really relaxes me, and is really the point of this post, is that I&#8217;m now (officially?) a classical guitarist! When I say &#8220;officially&#8221; I actually mean &#8220;I&#8217;ve been taking lessons for a year now&#8221;. I also try to pick up my guitar and practice every day (which can be a bit of a challenge sometimes). I&#8217;m far from the best, but I&#8217;m really starting to come along.</p>

<p>A bit of history. For a long time I&#8217;ve mucked around with guitars. I started at a younger age when I told my Dad that I was interested in learning. Rather than start with the boring stuff (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music)" title="Chord (music)">chords</a>) I dived into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerpicking" title="Fingerstyle Guitar">fingerpicking</a>. My desire to skip the &#8220;boring&#8221; stuff was fueled by listening to the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams_%28guitarist%29" title="John Williams (guitarist)">John Williams</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_emmanuel" title="Tommy Emmanuel">Tommy Emmanuel</a>. However, I found that my lack of understanding of the theory of music was a little bit of a downer, and I struggled to really come to grips with anything more than regurgitating songs. I wasn&#8217;t even very good at it! I was better than most fumblers, but I was far from good. More importantly, I was a long way from where I wanted to be.</p>

<p>As time went on I carried on fumbling through more and more tunes, and I even managed to blast out a few rippers such as Mist by <a href="http://www.johnbutlertrio.com/" title="John Butler Trio">JBT</a>. By this stage I was a little tired of it all for two reasons. The first was that I wasn&#8217;t really getting any better. All I was doing was increasing the number of songs that I could play (and I use the word <em>play</em> in its broadest possible sense). The second was that despite the lack of ability, I felt that a lot of the fingerstyle stuff was just too easy.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#8217;s a bit of a contradiction. Not improving, and finding it too easy don&#8217;t really go together. But bear with me. When I played the fingerstyle guitar, I didn&#8217;t feel like there was a great deal of mood. I didn&#8217;t think that by improving I&#8217;d feel the music any more than I already did. I know that sounds cheesy, but that&#8217;s how I felt.</p>

<p>I started to listen to classical guitar again. I got a few CDs of John Williams and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bream" title="Julian Bream">Julian Bream</a> and really started to feel it. I decided that it was past time to not only take on something a bit more challenging, but something that I thought would be more fulfilling and more relaxing.</p>

<p>So at the ripe old age of 27, I started looking for a teacher. This turned out to be a bit of a challenge. There are surprisingly few classical guitar teachers in Brisbane, and even fewer who have a passion for it. I found a few guys who said they&#8217;d teach it but it wasn&#8217;t their priority. That didn&#8217;t make sense to me, as I felt that if you&#8217;re going to be any good with classical guitar you&#8217;d need to make it your priority. So I stayed away.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, I managed to find a guy to teach me. Or, more correctly, my wife did. She mentioned my desire to learn classical to a work colleague of hers who just happened to be close friends with a &#8220;very good classical guitar teacher&#8221;. I called him up, had a chat, and signed up for lessons.</p>

<p>Now before I carry on about the stuff I&#8217;ve discovered since I started, I&#8217;d just like to spend a moment talking about my teacher. First of all, his name is Andre Reginato. He doesn&#8217;t have a website up at the moment (something I think I&#8217;ll help him with soon) otherwise I&#8217;d post a link. This guy is a champion. Not only is he a really nice bloke who makes lessons extremely enjoyable, but his passion for the classical guitar is palpable. On top of that he&#8217;s <em>extremely</em> talented, and a pleasure to listen to. It feels like a get a mini personal concert every time I have a lesson. It&#8217;s great. He&#8217;s the kind of teacher that you dream about. Seriously. He&#8217;s a real source of motivation for me. For any of you out there who are seeking a teacher in anything, make sure they&#8217;ve got passion for the subject. It makes a <strong>huge</strong> difference. I&#8217;ve been learning from Andre since around October last year, and I have loved every minute of it.</p>

<p>So anyway, back to the music. When I first got together with Andres, my experience with classical guitar as a player was non-existant. My experience as a listener, I thought, wasn&#8217;t too bad. Boy was I wrong. I thought JW was the be-all-and-end-all, except for maybe Julian Bream who seemed to put a bit more mood into his playing. It was at this point, thanks to Andre, that I was introduced to a man who is by far the best classical player I have ever heard. It just so happens to be the man who almost single-handedly put classical guitar on the music man. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don&#8217;t know him already, please put your hands together for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Segovia" title="Andres Segovia @ Wikipedia">Mr Andres</a> <a href="http://www.classicalguitar.net/artists/segovia/" title="Andres Segovia">Segovia</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re bored of the text and are interested in listening to him play, have a gander at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7hAMYPgiqU" title="Andres Segovia">this little doozy</a>:</p>

<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/h7hAMYPgiqU"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/h7hAMYPgiqU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>


<p>That should get the juices flowing a little :)</p>

<p>Of course, what I&#8217;m saying here is all my own opinion, and I&#8217;m certainly not preaching. But if anyone thinks that there&#8217;s another person currently in existence that plays better than this man, they&#8217;re quite simply wrong! :) Don&#8217;t believe me? Let&#8217;s have a little face-off shall we?</p>

<p>As I already mentioned, I thought JW was the bomb before I heard of Segovia, so let&#8217;s take a look at both of them playing the same tune. Let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEfFbuT3I6A" title="Asturias">JW</a>:</p>

<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oEfFbuT3I6A"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oEfFbuT3I6A" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>


<p>Impressive hey! The man&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo" title="Tremolo">tremolo</a> is just mind-blowing. If I could play anything like this guy one day I&#8217;d be very happy. Having said that, his playing just feels mechanical. His technique is spot on, but there&#8217;s so little mood. No feeling. Very little variation in the notes. It just doesn&#8217;t capture the tune in the way that I picture it in my head (if that makes any sense).</p>

<p>So in contrast, let&#8217;s take a look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaaXr1AjQb8" title="Leyenda">Segovia</a>:</p>

<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iaaXr1AjQb8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iaaXr1AjQb8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>


<p>Now I think that the reaction that most people here will have is that it&#8217;s not as good :) And that&#8217;s fine. The most obvious point is that the tempo just doesn&#8217;t feel the same as JW. But that&#8217;s the beauty of it. The mood is so different. There&#8217;s much more feeling and, dare I say it, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicality" title="Musicality">musicality</a>. Segovia&#8217;s music, to me, goes to a completely different level to JW.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I think Segovia is king over JW, I still listen to JW a lot. Then there&#8217;s Julian! A man who could play a fridge if it had strings! He&#8217;s incredible. In my view, he sits between Segovia and JW on the ranking list. How could he not with performances like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbW4rYYKxhg" title="Julian Bream - Villa Lobos">this one</a>:</p>

<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SbW4rYYKxhg"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SbW4rYYKxhg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object>


<p>Genius. And despite the crazy facial expressions, he&#8217;s a joy to watch.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to end the post, as it&#8217;s gone for a bit longer than I had first intended. I hope you guys enjoyed listening to these blokes. I think they&#8217;re absolutely amazing, and the three of them (along with my awesome teacher) are the guys that I really look up to.</p>

<p>Enjoy :)</p>
