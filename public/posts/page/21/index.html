  <div class="entry-content"><p>All too often have I seen comments like this. That&#8217;s if I&#8217;m lucky enough to see comments at all! I&#8217;m quite a big advocate of comments in code. I don&#8217;t agree with the age-old philosophy of:<blockquote>If the code was hard to write, it should be hard to read as well!</blockquote>I read a cool article this morning called <a href="http://www.developer.com/design/article.php/3642901" title="In Praise of the Lowly Comment" target="_blank">In Praise of the Lowly Comment</a>, which I think hits the mark nicely. I think I might just email this link around to my current workmates, as I don&#8217;t think they realise that commenting should consist of more that &#8216;TODO&#8217;s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you might not know about <a href="http://www.thewiggles.com.au/" title="The Wiggles" target="_blank">The Wiggles</a>, but those of you who are either Australian or have any connection with an extremely young family member will probably have a fair idea. In short, they&#8217;re a collection of dudes who do performances for kiddies, and have managed to make themselves a fortune putting smiles on the dials of kids all over the world. Hats off to them!</p>

<p>The question I&#8217;m asking isn&#8217;t serious ;) But I have to ask it because I think that one of their famous songs has been written with my current software development project in mind! The song I&#8217;m referring to is called Hot Potato. For a fab rendition, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/FV6nJxg7mM0" title="YouTube Video: The Wiggles" target="_blank">this YooooooouTube vid</a>. Feel free to play it a few times and get used to the dance moves :)</p>

<p>So, why do I think that these guys might have based the song on software dev? Well I think it&#8217;s very simple:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Hot potato</strong>: This refers to the job or task that noone wants to get done. It&#8217;s the feature that the client <em>really</em> wants that noone&#8217;s prepared to put the time into implementing. It could also mean a subsection of the system that was originally written to adhere to the &#8220;cold spaghetti&#8221; architecture, which has resulted in code that&#8217;s so hard to maintain the nobody wants to touch it.</li><li><strong>Cold Spaghetti</strong>: AKA &#8220;code spaghetti&#8221;. This is the overall architecture of the software system. It indicates the level of thought that was put into it, and gives a great visualisation of what the resulting code looks like. The beauty of the word &#8220;cold&#8221; in this scenario is that it adds a new dimension to the well known &#8220;spaghetti code&#8221; theory. As we all know, cold spaghetti <em>sticks together</em> in one nasty congealed clump of starchy mess, and dissecting it is a nightmare! Soooooo true in the case of spaghetti code.</li><li><strong>Mash Banana</strong>: Currently very regular in the project I&#8217;m working on! This is all those fabulous ideas that could possibly <em>improve</em> the quality of the system - but team members don&#8217;t like the tall poppies so those ideas are mashed to a pulp so that they never see the light of day and hence don&#8217;t make the rest of the team feel insecure due to them not thinking of the idea themselves.</li></ul>


<p>See, it all makes sense!</p>

<p>&#8230; or am I barking mad?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steam" target="_blank">Steam</a> first hit the marketplace lots of people thought it wasn&#8217;t going to take off - and the bigger companies didn&#8217;t <em>want</em> it to. Over time it really gathered momentum. The bugs were being ironed out, the process was working well, and the subscriber count was going through the roof. As more time went by, some smaller indies signed up to use Steam to deliver their games - giving the small player a chance to get a great deal of exposure to their game at a pretty small cost and at the same time allowing it to be delivered onto desktops <strong>on demand</strong>. Awesome stuff!</p>

<p>So as expected, the bigger players are wanting a piece of the action now that the theory has been proven. EA are the latest contenders in this market, and they&#8217;ve recently attempted to release their competing product - <em>EA Link</em>.</p>

<p>The release didn&#8217;t actually go according to plan. In fact, according to
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35555" title="EA tries to clone Steam, but fails miserably" target="_blank">The Inq</a>, it is:<blockquote>&#8230; so buggy that it just doesn&#8217;t work, and the EULAs are scary.</blockquote> Nice! Not just that, but it also has some nasty side-effects with regards to privacy:<blockquote>I read the second EULA they presented, and this one is much darker and less user friendly than the last. I got about a third into it before I decided that the terms were unacceptable, basically they could use my personal info and share it around.</blockquote></p>

<p>It looks like the only similarity that EA&#8217;s first iteration can draw to Valve&#8217;s baby is that there is some sort of stinky vapour rising from it - which technically is a form of steam.</p>

<p>So, feel free to use EA Link if you&#8217;re happy to have your innards shared with EA. If not, stick to something that&#8217;s tried, tested and proven: <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steam" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know for sure that many of the geeks out there on the World Wide Wibbly have the &#8220;fun&#8221; task of sorting out every possible computer issue for any/all of their family and friends in the cases where they&#8217;re not geeks themselves. I am one such geek, and I&#8217;ll be honest and say that I do not mind helping out. It&#8217;s actually a bit of fun! I starting pondering thoughts on this topic when I stumbled across Roy&#8217;s <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/posts/MomPC-_2D00_-Creating-a-parent-safe-PC.aspx" title="ISerializable - Roy Osherove's Blog : MomPC - Creating a parent safe PC" target="_blank">MomPC</a> blog post a week or two ago. I read the post with interest and think that it&#8217;s quite a handy little reference for those people looking to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>By the same token, I think there are some gaps in what was said. I also think that there&#8217;s a fundamental flaw in the assumption that Windows XP has to be used as the operating system. I&#8217;ll get onto that point a bit more in a moment, but for now I&#8217;d like to comment on a few other options that Roy hasn&#8217;t covered.</p>

<p><strong><u>Firewall</u></strong></p>

<p>The main reasons for having a software firewall on Windows is to prevent nasty trojans from getting <em>out</em> to do their thing, and to prevent other trojans and script kiddies (<em>skiddies</em>) from getting <em>in</em>. Windows Defender is indeed one option, but it&#8217;s not the only one. <a href="http://www.webmasterfree.com/tpfw.html" title="Tiny Firewall" target="_blank">Tiny Firewall</a> is a nice option (though it looks like it might not be supported any more!) which is free for home use, and there&#8217;s always <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/company/products/znalm/freeDownload.jsp?dc=12bms&ctry=GB&lang=en" title="Zone Labs ZoneAlarm" target="_blank">ZoneAlarm</a> which is also free for home use. These two do a good enough job as well. The latter has improved somewhat now that it no longer &#8220;phones home&#8221; while protecting you :)</p>

<p><strong><u>Antivirus</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a huge advocate of AVG, so I don&#8217;t agree with Roy on this point. Instead I have found that both the 32 and 64-bit versions of <a href="http://www.avast.com/" title="Avast" target="_blank">Avast</a> do a <em>very</em> good job of keeping the baddies at bay. I&#8217;ve been using this for well over a year now at home, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. People&#8217;s experiences do vary though, so take my comments with a grain of salt. If you&#8217;re looking for a freebie that&#8217;s good, then Avast is a winner.</p>

<p><strong><u>Email</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d strongly recommend the use of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/" title="Mozilla Thunderbird" target="_blank">Thunderbird</a> for all email-based stuff. This removes the need for having Outlook and/or Outlook Express installed at all. It&#8217;s got a built-in news reader and RSS feed reader, and is basically a fabulous comms application - better yet it&#8217;s a freebie!</p>

<p><strong><u>Office Applications</u></strong></p>

<p>For most home users, I personally feel that buying a licenced copy of Microsoft Office is overkill. People write a letter here and there, they might open a few word docs that are downloaded off the web, or want to open up some crappy powerpoint presentation with the latest &#8220;fluffy bunnies in tu-tus wishing you wealth, happiness and friendship for the rest of your days&#8221; accompanied with some cheezy music and awful text animations.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" title="OpenOffice" target="_blank">OpenOffice</a> is more than sufficient for these purposes. Again, it&#8217;s free software, it has fairly regular releases (given that it&#8217;s a rather large application) and it&#8217;s cross-platform too. I can&#8217;t see the need to go for another office application which costs a fortune when 9 time out of 10 this will suffice.</p>

<p>Of course, there are cases where people need more than just a standard word processor. OpenOffice has its quirks and pitfalls, and if you&#8217;re looking to go for a package with a lot of functionality then MS Office might just be on the cards for you.</p>

<p><strong><u>Browser</u></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/" title="FireFox" target="_blank">FireFox</a>. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Key Point - What Operating System?</u></strong></p>

<p>As I stated at the start of this post, I&#8217;m not really sure why Windows XP has to be the default installation for a family PC. The big thing that most people will focus on here is usability, followed closely by the range of software and support for things such as scanners, digital cameras and MP3 players - which you can&#8217;t argue with to a point.</p>

<p>In Roy&#8217;s case, I think Windows XP is unnecessary. I think a default installation of Ubuntu with all the required software set up would be more than enough for the default family PC. It&#8217;d be a lot easier to secure, wouldn&#8217;t require constant maintenance and reinstalling every few months like Windows does, and doesn&#8217;t cost a bean. Ubuntu with FireFox, Thunderbird, OpenOffice and perhaps a few games (Solitaire, Mahjongg, etc) would keep the average non-geek family member amused for hours, and would probably cover most, if not all, of the things that the users want to do. The set up of a software firewall wouldn&#8217;t be so much of an issue since there&#8217;s very little (to no) malware that runs on Linux, hence it&#8217;s probably not needed. You don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to run antivirus software (though I still think you should) on Linux as 99.99999% of viruses are targetted at the Windows platform. Finally, auto-updates are on by default which means the OS keeps itself up to date just like the Auto-update feature of Windows.</p>

<p>Bring on Ubuntu installs for the family I say! There&#8217;s no need to give yourself the extra workload of maintaining a family Windows machine when it doesn&#8217;t have to have Windows running on it. Do yourself, and your family a favour - get yourself a Linus distro, and just see how much longer it lasts before you have to blast it away and reinstall from scratch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a regular reader of <a href="http://www.thedailywtf.com/" title="The Daily WTF" target="_blank">The Daily WTF</a> and most of the time I get a good laugh and think to myself &#8220;Boy, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not working on <em>that</em> system.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I get to work and find myself looking at very similar instances of WTFness in the applications I am working on. I think that the level of WTFness in the industry at the moment is sufficiently high enough to make it difficult for a Daily WTF site to cover all the cases. So, while remaining an avid fan and subscriber of the site, I&#8217;ve decided to start posting my own WTFs that I&#8217;ve seen along the way, with obfuscation and code changes to protect the &#8230;er&#8230; guilty. This may become a fairly regular posting category for me.</p>

<p>What I will say before posting my first example is that there might be some cases where the WTFness isn&#8217;t immediately obvious, or the point of the WTF is so small it might be considered &#8220;nit-picking&#8221;. All I can say to that is: if I think it&#8217;s a WTF I&#8217;m going to post it :) Feel free to comment if you feel like it.</p>

<p>So, today I&#8217;m going to start with a couple of files that I&#8217;ve stumbled across which contain an <strong>insane</strong> amount of code. Bear in mind that this system contains a <em>lot</em> of files - there are a lot more files that fit into this category.</p>

<p><img id="image111" src="/uploads/2006/11/wtf.png" alt="File Size WTF" class="InlineImageBlock" /></p>

<p>Yup, that&#8217;s just <strong>3</strong> files. One of them is the code-behind for a web user control (ascx.cs) which contains a 1.5k line Page_PreRender() function.</p>

<p>WTFness: 8 / 10.</p>

<hr />


<p>Edit: I just thought I&#8217;d let you know that these code files are <strong>not</strong> generated. They&#8217;ve all been hand-coded!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found a pretty inspiring video the other day that I think is a perfect visual representation of what should happen in software. OK, that&#8217;s not quite true, I didn&#8217;t <em>find</em> it, I was given it by none other than Dan the man (@shifty). The video is a time-lapsed video of someone drawing a picture of a wasp-like insect (I don&#8217;t pretend to be cluey in the world of insects, so just be happy with that description :)), but the beauty of it is that you can see how the final product evolves as the picture is iterated.</p>

<p>So, on with the video. The first link I found is located <a href="http://www.ursispaltenstein.ch/blog/weblog.php?/weblog/the_daily_drawing/" title="Ursi's Blog" target="_blank">here</a>, but for some reason I&#8217;m having issues getting to that address. The video is also mirrored <a href="http://www.ursispaltenstein.ch/cgi-bin/EE/index.php?/weblog/the_daily_drawing/" title="Ursi's Blog" target="_blank">here</a> - it&#8217;s about 5 or 6 minutes long, but it&#8217;s worth watching.</p>

<p>Finished? Good. Now imagine that drawing as a piece of software. What would you liken it to? I&#8217;m sure we could all draw a few comparisons, but the thing I wanted to focus on was the iteration and constant improvement. When the artist started out, there was a very basic outline of what it was he/she wanted to draw. After 30 seconds of the video, it was clear to the viewer that the goal was to be a wasp - and at that point the artist could have stopped. The drawing was far from finished, but it did solve the main problem of &#8220;creating a wasp drawing&#8221;. This, to me, is exactly the same as attempting to create a code solution to a problem the very first time, and assuming that it&#8217;s sufficient enough to release as production code.</p>

<p>The more you iterate, the better your software will be. Your understanding of the problem increases each time you iterate, and you start to see areas of the problem that you didn&#8217;t initially realise existed. This gives you more opportunities to iterate and improve, iterate and improve. Over time your solution becomes a very clearly defined and good looking wasp, with colours, specular highlights, and even hair on the legs.</p>

<p>I think that your software should come alive in the same way that the drawing did. The only way for this to happen - iterate.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason I thought that the I.T. industry as a whole had matured enough to the point that all developers would have realised that programming with an ego has a bad affect on the software. I also thought that people would stay up to speed, work hard, and focus on producing good quality code. I am very much mistaken :)</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been in the unfortunate position of having to deal with some of the most appalling I.T. professionals in the industry (I used the word &#8220;professional&#8221; in its broadest possible sense!), and the software that&#8217;s oozing out of the team is a reflection of the quality of the individuals therein. I could rant for ages about the coding horrors, bad practices and lack of understanding, but that to a point has already been discussed in a previous post (see: <a href="/posts/the-day-job/" title="The Day Job">The Day Job</a>). Instead I&#8217;m going to focus on the one point that I feel is one of the root causes of the trouble: <strong>EGO</strong>.</p>

<p>These people are clearly unaware of what it means to undertake egoless programming. They don&#8217;t seem to realise the damage that they&#8217;re doing in behaving the way they do. They&#8217;re so protective of their own work, and so ignorant of everyone else&#8217;s that the result is what can only be described as a <em>Pot Mess</em>. ie. A pot with nothing but a huge mess in it.  If you&#8217;re unaware of the general concept of egoless programming, check out <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000584.html" title="Coding Horror: The Ten Commandments of Egoless Programming" target="_blank">this link over at Coding Horror</a> - it covers the 10 commandments of egoless programming - and while you&#8217;re reading that, please pray to the Development Gods and sacrifice a few Cobol programmers to them to help appease them for my sake, as I fear there&#8217;s no other hope for me :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a final post for today, I just got sent <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1123221217782777472" title="Windows Vista Speech Recognition Demo Gone Awry - Google Video" target="_blank">this classic Google Video</a> from Dan over at Shifty. It&#8217;s pretty funny!</p>

<p>Having said that, I&#8217;m sure that most devs know how tough something like voice recognition can be to build.  Try demoing something like this to the world, it&#8217;d be an absolute nightmare! I do feel a bit sorry for this guy, as I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s not the one responsible for the internal workings of the software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had this link archived for a little while, and today&#8217;s the day I decided to be arsed to comment on it. A long-term blogger known as Greg posted about what he&#8217;s learned about blogging in his <a href="http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/2006/10/2000th-post.html" title="2,000th Post" target="_blank">2000th blog post</a>. I enjoyed reading it, and it made me ask myself the questions:</p>

<ul><li>What do you get out of blogging?</li><li>What is it you <em>want</em> to get out of blogging</li><li>Do you feel like you have to post at least once per day?</li><li>Do you think your blog is a &#8216;successful&#8217; blog?</li></ul>


<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about these questions for a little while, and now I think I finally have a couple of answers, and I&#8217;d like to share them with you.</p>

<p><strong><u>What do you get out of blogging?</u></strong></p>

<p>Well, I think blogging is definitely a very personal thing (duh!), and it&#8217;s important for the blogger to feel like they&#8217;re getting something worthwhile out of investing their time in a blog. I feel like I get a lot out of blogging.</p>

<p>The first is it&#8217;s a bit of a venting mechanism. Sometimes I want to share ideas, sometimes I want to scream in joy about nailing an issue (such as getting ATi drivers working in Ubuntu :), sometimes I feel like I just want to get something off my chest. To me, my blog is a means of dumping my thoughts in a place where other people can share and enjoy them. Sure, some people might <em>hate</em> them, but that&#8217;s ok! :) All they have to do is choose another URL and they&#8217;ll be redirected away from my obnoxiousness.</p>

<p>I find that having a venting/ranting location is good for me as a professional. I share some frustration and learn from what other people have to say. I hope that other people can come here and learn from my experiences too.</p>

<p>On a slightly different tact, I use it as a means to make myself stay up to date with what&#8217;s going on in the industry. I like to read a lot of news sites, and every now and then I&#8217;ll post interesting bits of news that I&#8217;ve found along the way. I try not to post things that aren&#8217;t interesting, though I may not succeed all the time. An let&#8217;s face it, &#8220;interesting&#8221; is a matter of opinion, so chances are a lot of people will come here and find my blogs and links completely shit-boring. I feel the need to share this kind of information around as much as I can. I get a lot out of staying in touch with things, and I am sure that I&#8217;m not the only one. This is just another way of spreading the wealth.</p>

<p>By the same token, I am a teacher by nature :) I do like to teach people. As I&#8217;ve said in my previous posts, I think that Software Development isn&#8217;t a black art that should be kept secret. Knowledge and information should be shared, and this blog gives me another way of working to that philosophy. You can post tips and snippets of code for people to read and do what they want with. You can post challenges and watch other people&#8217;s minds at work. You can literally provoke all kinds of thought! It&#8217;s quite amazing.</p>

<p>Finally, I love hearing what other people have to say about what I&#8217;ve posted. I used to run a forum or two a while back and they were great fun. People can be really amazing, and their comments and ideas are extremely thought provoking. Not only is it good when you find like-minded people coming here to post their thoughts, but even more so when someone with a completely different outlook comes along and points out something that you hadn&#8217;t really thought about before. The bloggosphere is a great place for the encouragement of interesting discussion about any topic you feel like discussing.  I find it not only enlightening, but extremely entertaining.</p>

<p><strong><u>What is it you <em>want</em> to get out of blogging</u></strong></p>

<p>I am lucky as far as my blog goes. For the most part I get everything that I want (see the list above :)). There are some gaps though. I would like more frequent and more in-depth responses from people, but that&#8217;s something I can&#8217;t expect. I would like to see more people come out with comments on why what I&#8217;ve said is <em>bad or wrong</em> - after all, I want it to be a good learning experience for me too.</p>

<p>As a writer (if I&#8217;m allowed to say that, since there&#8217;s a chance that I&#8217;m technically <em>not</em> a writer in the true sense of the word) I like people to read what I write! I like people to read it, enjoy reading it and not struggle to get through it (especially when I&#8217;ve written a fair bit :)). I&#8217;ve had some people comment (verbally) that they enjoy reading what I write, as it&#8217;s entertaining and light-hearted. I hope that I continue to wrote posts in a manner which gives people this kind of feeling. That&#8217;s something that I would like to see more of :) I like the idea of people reading my posts and <em>enjoying</em> the experience even if they don&#8217;t agree with anything I&#8217;ve said.</p>

<p><strong><u>Do you feel like you have to post at least once per day?</u></strong></p>

<p>Well, yes I do. I want to keep my blog &#8220;alive&#8221;. I want people to come back to the site knowing that there&#8217;s a good chance of finding something new. I know what it&#8217;s like to go to a place that you find interesting and be disappointed that there&#8217;s no new content up there to enjoy. The problem here is that if you post every day even if you don&#8217;t really have anything meaningful to say then you start to reduce the quality of your blog.</p>

<p>So, let me answer by saying this: I feel like every time I post it has to be interesting, or funny (or both ;)). I feel that posting quality is more important than posting quantity - but I would very much like to have both quality <em>and</em> quantity.  I&#8217;ll be focussing on the former, and hope that the latter happens by itself :)</p>

<p>As a final comment on this point - I think <a href="http://keithjudge.com/musings/?p=4" title="What's it all about?" target="_blank">Keef&#8217;s recent blog post</a> is bang on with regards to blog content. In general people don&#8217;t want to hear what you have had for breakfast, or whether or not the cat&#8217;s puked on the carpet again. Day to day activities, in my opinion, are one of the most boring things to read about on blogs (unless of course you can make an entertaining story out of it - at which point it&#8217;s no longer a mundane activity). If I ever post something like this, please DDoS my site :) (ok, that&#8217;s not your cue to DDoS regardless).</p>

<p><strong><u>Do you think your blog is a &#8216;successful&#8217; blog?</u></strong></p>

<p>I think this question is essentially asking &#8220;Do you get everything you want out of your blog?&#8221;. Success is relative to the person viewing the site. In my eyes, my site isn&#8217;t totally successful, but I don&#8217;t consider it to be unsuccessful. I&#8217;ve already had some interesting posts with some very interesting responses. I have a fair few subscribers to my RSS feed who read what I write on a fairly regular basis, and that&#8217;s very fulfilling. I enjoy writing, and I enjoy seeing my blog live and breathe.</p>

<p>I think my blog is more successful than not, but I do think that there&#8217;s room for improvement. I reckon the readers will have a stack of suggestions for improvement (so feel free to post them).</p>

<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>

<p>I have enjoyed this little brain-dump immensely. I hope you guys enjoy reading it, particularly those of you who have your own blogs. Let me know what you think as far as what makes your blog an enjoyable experience as I&#8217;m sure many people&#8217;s views will differ greatly from mine.</p>

<p>Next up, I&#8217;m probably going post something that&#8217;s more along the rant/vent lines. The need to get some frustration out is quite large, and this is the ideal place to stick it - especially after a week as bad as this one!</p>
