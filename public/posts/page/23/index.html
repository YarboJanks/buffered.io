  <div class="entry-content"><p>And so the Vista malarky continues! More and more details of the behemoth that is Vista are coming to light which, quite frankly, freak me out even more.</p>

<p>First of all, <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/2006/10/microsoft-denies-some-vista-editions.html" target="_blank" title="virtualization.info: Microsoft denies some Vista editions to run virtualized">Microsoft won&#8217;t let you run some Vista editions virtualised</a>, which is a bit of a surprise. Why would they push for free Virtual PC software and then not let you use some basic versions of the new OS under such a set up?</p>

<p>Secondly, despite there being large support for a 3D desktop, the coverage in the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35084" title="Vista RC 2 gaming with Nvidia not there yet" target="_blank">game area is lacking</a>. WTF is going on here? So we&#8217;re going to make it hard for the gamers to move over as well? This is just unbelievable.</p>

<p>I think that <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=227f20b1-adfe-4361-b776-111a7069f622" title="From 9 till 2 - Vista the Adventure Game" target="_blank">this</a> nugget of genius sums it up nicely :) This will hit home for those who have spent any time in text-based adventure games and/or MUDs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I shouldn&#8217;t laugh about this, but I couldn&#8217;t help it :)</p>

<p>Any geek that&#8217;s in a relationship has probably heard the words &#8220;GET AWAY FROM THAT <strong>!$@*ING</strong> COMPUTER!&#8221; (or something along those lines) more than once. Even if you haven&#8217;t, you might have heard it from your mum when you were a budding geek (as I was).</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34990" title="Reiser4 inventor arrested for murder" target="_blank">this article on The Inquirer</a> I couldn&#8217;t help but think that this bloke had hard that phrase possibly one too many times?!</p>

<p>All joking aside, it&#8217;s quite shocking to think that someone like this could possibly have done something pretty nasty like this.</p>

<p>While browsing through the recent cartoons, I noticed that there was a link to <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/" title="The Dilbert Blog" target="_blank">Scott Adam&#8217;s Blog</a> which I proceeded to follow and I was greeted with some really interesting reading.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes this is old news to anyone who reads any form of news :) But Google have bought YouTube! How exciting. Personally, I&#8217;m very happy for those lads who set YouTube up in the first place. The idea was based on the need to share some large homes videos of parties with mates who weren&#8217;t there, and it&#8217;s turned into a multi-billion dollar empire. It&#8217;s good to hear that there are people out there like this still making something big for themselves for having the balls to give it a go.</p>

<p>On a slightly more sour note, it looks like the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35026" target="_blank">lawsuits</a> will start queuing up. Everyone with any connection to some of the &#8220;unauthorised&#8221; content on YouTube will probably join the long line of would-be beneficiaries from sueing Google/YouTube for breach of copyright. Let&#8217;s hope that this kind of thing is nipped in the bud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Inquirer has posted up some info on the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35057" title="Microsoft Vista licence restrictions hit hardware hard" target="_blank">Microsoft Vista licence restrictions</a> and boy does it sound awful. Not only will it cost you an arm and a leg to buy it, you&#8217;ll probably have to upgrade to get it to run, and after you&#8217;ve upgraded you&#8217;ll probably never be allowed to upgrade again - otherwise you&#8217;ll need a new copy of Vista!</p>

<p>So, you&#8217;re screwed in more ways than one. Every bit of news I&#8217;m hearing about Vista is scaring me at the moment. I really can&#8217;t see why MS are taking the stance their taking and forcing such a pile-o-poop on its customers. If it goes the way their previous licence handling has gone (see my prior blog post on issues with Office Activation), then this is just going to be a hindrance to the honest paying customer, and the hackers are the ones who&#8217;ll have it easy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be sticking with XP, Gentoo and Ubuntu! MS can take their licencing, their DRM and their snooping and stick it where the sun doesn&#8217;t shine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a regular read of Scott Gu&#8217;s blog (see blogroll) I often find nuggets of information that are handy for the work that I do, but I also often end up with a few questions :)</p>

<p>The latest one that fired up a bit of thought was his post on <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/posts/Tip_2F00_Trick_3A00_-Guard-Against-SQL-Injection-Attacks.aspx" title="Guard Against SQL Injection Attacks" target="_blank">guarding against SQL injection attacks</a>.  The information posted very handy, and is something that I would assume most web developers already know, but it made me wonder how many devs out there <em>are</em> actually aware of these kinds of issues while they&#8217;re building their applications.</p>

<p>I starting hacking code together from a young age, and I&#8217;ve written my fair share of code that I hope to God never made it onto the web :) I&#8217;d like to think that over the time that I&#8217;ve spent reading, writing and working I&#8217;ve gained a pretty good coverage of the code security issues that are faced when building all kinds of applications - though I&#8217;m sure I have a stack more to learn! One thing struck me though, and that was that almost none of this stuff was covered during my course of formal study at University.</p>

<p>I transferred to different Unis during my time as a student, and out of the 3 that I went to, <strong>none</strong> of them had any form of code security as part of the core syllabus. Sure, there were special subjects that you could take which focussed on things such as this, including SQL injection, buffer overflows, etc, but you actually had to <em>choose the subject</em> out of a stack of others to get a good amount of exposure to the principles.</p>

<p>As time goes by, it becomes harder and harder for the developer to get themselves into trouble when writing code due to the nature of the languages and the support that you get via the accompanying frameworks - but we do manage to find new and startling ways of creating holes in our softy that the malicious and crafty can exploit.</p>

<p>So I do think that learning at least the basics of code security (particularly in web-based environments) is something that every developer should do.  Sure, if you&#8217;re using C# you might not have to worry about buffer overflows. If you&#8217;re not using an SQL back-end, you won&#8217;t have to worry about SQL injection. Regardless of the application and language, there are always different ways in which you can slip up. Coverage should be <strong>mandatory</strong> in courses at any formal education centre so that budding developers are aware of those issues before they hit the streets. To me, this is as obvious as having English and Maths as mandatory subjects during school if you&#8217;re going to work as a coder!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted this problem a little while ago on the site I used to run, and it proved to be an interesting one that resulted in quite a large collection of solutions from the posters. So here it is again.</p>

<p>Your job is to write a program that generates a text-based ruler. For a clearer definition of what I mean, see the little text pic below:</p>

<pre><code>|                               |                               |
|               |               |               |               |
|       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
</code></pre>

<p>The user of the program must be able to specify a couple of parameters: those being the <em>height</em> of the ruler and the <em>number of sections</em> in the ruler (at the top level).  In the above example, the values would be <strong>6</strong> and <strong>2</strong> respectively.  Another example, using the values <strong>3</strong> and <strong>3</strong> would result in:</p>

<pre><code>|   |   |   |
| | | | | | |
|||||||||||||
</code></pre>

<p>The only other thing that you have to do is make sure that your solution uses <strong><u>recursion</u></strong> instead of iteration.  Feel free to use any language you want, you can write to screen or to file, it&#8217;s your call. But you <strong>must</strong> use recursion.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing your responses. :) Happy coding!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a read of Eastabrook&#8217;s blog recently (see a link in the Blogroll) and noticed that he posted about an interesting link that he found.  The link, entitled <a href="http://www.fboweb.com/antest/ge/intro.aspx?old=1" title="Flight Tracking in 3D" target="_blank">Flight Tracking in 3D</a>, shows details of a few downloads that you can grab for <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth" target="_blank">Google Earth</a> which actually show the current locations of <strong>flights that are currently in progress all over the world!!!</strong></p>

<p>Unbelievable. Pretty amazing technology, and at the same time quite scary. What kind of possible security issues does this feature open up?  I know that Google Earth has had these kinds of questions asked in the past, but this to me seems like it&#8217;s taking the issue to a whole new level.</p>
