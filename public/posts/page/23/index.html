  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php" target="_blank" title="Open Source (OSI) Logo"><img src="http://www.opensource.org/trademarks/opensource/web/opensource-110x95.png" alt="Open Source (OSI) Logo" border="0" width="110" height="95" class="InlineImageRight" /></a>I&#8217;ve been interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software" title="Open Source Software" target="_blank">Open Source Software</a> (OSS) for quite some time now but I&#8217;ve never really attempted to find out much about it, nor how I can contribute. Of course, being a professional developer, the immediate thought is &#8220;I make a living off writing software, so how does that work with Open Source?&#8221;.</p>

<p>After reading all the news about Vista and it&#8217;s attempts to completely revoke my rights as a user, my interest in the OSS movement in general has increased, and I do feel it&#8217;s time for me to not only get a better understanding of what it is and how it works, but how I can contribute to it.</p>

<p>What is it about OSS that makes it work? Is it possible to support yourself and a family off the fruits of your labours if you&#8217;re working in the OSS community? Is it going to provide the challenges I want from my job? Is it a valid model for writing bespoke software as per a client&#8217;s request?</p>

<p>If you ask <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34998" title="Open Source a billion dollar market" target="_blank">The Inquirer</a> they&#8217;ll tell you that:<blockquote>Getting your head around Open Source is a bit easier, and according to Bernard Dalle, from VC firm Index Ventures the movement, if you can still call it a movement, is accelerating like there&#8217;s no tomorrow.</p>

<p>He said there are around 120,000 Open Source projects up and running. &#8220;We&#8217;re not asking ourselves whether we can make money out of open source any more,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And better than that, it&#8217;s &#8220;a billion dollar market, going at a 40 or 50 per cent rate&#8221;.</blockquote>
I don&#8217;t know about you but that sounds pretty darned impressive to me! So how do you get involved?</p>

<p>Looks like there are a few ways :)</p>

<p><strong><u>1. SourceForge</u></strong></p>

<p>Point you browser at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/" title="SourceForge" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>, have a browse through the plethora of OSS projects that are running (trust me, there&#8217;s a <em>shitload</em>), and join in! Most of the time the developers are keen to get help whenever they can. If you find that you&#8217;re stills aren&#8217;t up to date, then you&#8217;re going to have to make an effort to get up to speed before you can contribute.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t find a project that you&#8217;re interested in, or people aren&#8217;t necessarily interested in having you join in, then you can always start your own. You don&#8217;t have to find something that noone else is doing, all you have to do is come up with something you&#8217;d be interested in working on, and ask the guys at SF.net to set up a project for you. Then you&#8217;re in full control, and you can begin work straight away.</p>

<p><strong><u>2. Just go it Alone</u></strong></p>

<p>This is always a viable option, but people tend to &#8220;die out&#8221; when doing things this way. Get your own web space, and set up the development project yourself. It takes a pretty dedicated person to go through this kind of development task by themselves and see it through to the end without getting any help along the way.  I think that if you want to make sure you keep on track, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to try to get a few people to work with you, otherwise you may find that your motivation starts to drop and you don&#8217;t end up finishing (which is the bane of many programmers).</p>

<p><strong><u>3. Sign up for Contract OSS Work</u></strong></p>

<p>I stumbled across this idea via the Larkware Site (see &#8220;Sites for Geeks&#8221; on the right) and thought it was pretty neat.  There&#8217;s a site currently being built which, by the looks of it, is designed to be a hub and a resource for employers and developers writing OSS. The site is called <a href="http://www.assembla.com/" title="Assembla" target="_blank">Assembla</a>, and is currently in the throws of being set up properly, though it looks like there is at least some form of collaboration and linking mechanism up there.  This could well be a way for potential OSS developers to get involved with a company <em>anywhere in the world</em> and aid them in building OSS. What a great idea!!  To pouch a snippet from the site:<blockquote>We take the best practices from <strong>open source</strong> and <strong>agile methodologies</strong>, and <strong>distributed teams</strong> and adapt them for commercial software development. It&#8217;s not typical contracting or outsourcing, but a third way that gets you the best talent available in the world, exactly when you need it, as part of a single global team. So, take advantage of our free development workspaces for distributed teams, advertise yourself as a developer, apply to work on Assembla projects, or get fast, full-service development and launch.</blockquote></p>

<p><strong><u>4. Use your Imagination</u></strong></p>

<p>The point here is, the concept of OSS is pretty simple, so you could create software, zip up the source and send it to people through spam if you really wanted to :) The limit is your imagination, so use it! There are a stack of other ways you can get involved, and there&#8217;s really nothing stopping you.</p>

<p><strong><u>A Common Misconception</u></strong></p>

<p>OSS doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean free, and free doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean OSS. It&#8217;s important to get an understanding of the difference between the two. Also, it&#8217;s fairly common for naive devs to think that you can&#8217;t write OSS on a Windows platform due to the nature of MS - again, that&#8217;s wrong. The software you create you can do whatever the hell you want with - if that includes releasing the source to the masses, then so be it. Be careful though, if you&#8217;re writing software for a client and they&#8217;re <em>paying</em> you to write it for them, make sure that you own the IP or there is a clause in your contract that states that you&#8217;re able to release the source if you want to before you actually do it. The last thing you want is to have a law suit on your hands.</p>

<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>

<p>My knowledge of OSS is pretty limited, but from reading around the web and speaking to some mates who are in on it, I&#8217;m finding that I&#8217;m getting quite excited about it. It not only sounds interesting, but it looks like fun as well! A good start would be to get familiar with some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license" title="Open Source Licence" target="_blank">licencing</a> models such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" title="GPL" target="_blank">GPL</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License" title="LGPL" target="_blank">LGPL</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Public_License" title="APL" target="_blank">APL</a>.</p>

<p>So, if there are devs out there wasting time by reading blogs such as this ;) Get off ya butts and start contributing, you never know where it may take you! I for one will be scouting the options for something to contribute to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, so it looks like I might have been misinformed (er&#8230; wrong :)) by stating that the basic versions of Vista can&#8217;t be installed on VMs. That&#8217;ll teach me not to read the licencing details properly myself! It looks like it was a slight misunderstanding of the terms and structure that MS used in stating the rules. I won&#8217;t go into the details myself since <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=157" title="No, theres no ban on virtual Vista" target="_blank">Ed Bott has already done it for me</a>. So, MS <em>haven&#8217;t</em> shot themselves in the foot in this regard, but they still seem to be doing it in other ways.</p>

<p>One of those ways, which is now 100% confirmed, is that you can only move your installation of Vista to a different machine (read: different hardware) <strong>once and once <em>only</em></strong>. Again, this is confirmed courtesty of <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=156" title="A sneaky change in Windows licensing terms" target="_blank">Ed Bott</a>. Instead of being able to reinstall when you buy a new mobo, and then reinstall again after you buy a new CPU, you may well have to fork out for another Vista licence due to the hardware change. What a lovely feature!</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s chat (via previous post on Vista) with Bryce got me thinking about what other peoples&#8217; thoughts were regarding the whole stance MS are taking with Vista, and during my searches I found <a href="http://www.computerpoweruser.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/c0611/44c11/44c11.asp&guid=8CF5E5CB35CB42E1857F6F42970E2A2C" title="Vista Will Double Apples Market Share" target="_blank">this post by Chris Pirillo</a> (a long-time MS user) which covers his views on said topic. It&#8217;s quite an interesting read :) He also took a bit of time to post on his blog after writing the article to cover some <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/posts/microsoft-windows-vista-vs-apple-os-x/" title="Microsoft Windows Vista vs. Apple OS X" target="_blank">other points</a>, again well worth reading.  It&#8217;s good to see another long-term MS user with the balls to speak out loud and say that Macs are becoming more appealing by the day.  I agree with him when he says that MS isn&#8217;t really making this a difficult decision to make.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of Macs, partly because I never had to use them and Windows was familiar, but as time goes by I&#8217;m rethinking my position. I keep saying that there&#8217;s not enough software out there for me to make the move to Mac (and Linux), but not I&#8217;m thinking that I need to make the switch and become one of the developers that can help sort that problem out :D</p>

<p>So, sorry about my stuff up, but it doesn&#8217;t really improve my view of Vista by much anyway!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Search Kings have come up with another rippin&#8217; tool which allows you to crawl through source code for examples and whatnot. The <a href="http://google.com/codesearch" title="Code Search" target="_blank">Google Code Search</a> is quite a cool utility - but it doesn&#8217;t come without it&#8217;s issues. I found an interesting link worthy of reading which talks about a few <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/google-code-search" target="_blank">amusing results</a> returned from this facility, which I reckon lots of people should check out and be aware of.</p>

<p>So this begs the question: Is this going to be a tool which allows hackers to get acceess to bugs in software a heck of a lot quicker? I believe so. Is that a bad thing? No, I don&#8217;t think so. In fact, it&#8217;ll teach developers (the hard way) that they need to be aware of security issues well before they release the code - which can only be a good thing as it should have a positive affect on the software.</p>

<p>As a small side note, there can also be some <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/posts/code_outrage/" title="Apple in code search profanity outrage" target="_blank">embarrassing snippets</a> revealed which will make the big names cringe. So, maybe this will also teach developers to be a little more professional!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And so the Vista malarky continues! More and more details of the behemoth that is Vista are coming to light which, quite frankly, freak me out even more.</p>

<p>First of all, <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/2006/10/microsoft-denies-some-vista-editions.html" target="_blank" title="virtualization.info: Microsoft denies some Vista editions to run virtualized">Microsoft won&#8217;t let you run some Vista editions virtualised</a>, which is a bit of a surprise. Why would they push for free Virtual PC software and then not let you use some basic versions of the new OS under such a set up?</p>

<p>Secondly, despite there being large support for a 3D desktop, the coverage in the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35084" title="Vista RC 2 gaming with Nvidia not there yet" target="_blank">game area is lacking</a>. WTF is going on here? So we&#8217;re going to make it hard for the gamers to move over as well? This is just unbelievable.</p>

<p>I think that <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=227f20b1-adfe-4361-b776-111a7069f622" title="From 9 till 2 - Vista the Adventure Game" target="_blank">this</a> nugget of genius sums it up nicely :) This will hit home for those who have spent any time in text-based adventure games and/or MUDs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I shouldn&#8217;t laugh about this, but I couldn&#8217;t help it :)</p>

<p>Any geek that&#8217;s in a relationship has probably heard the words &#8220;GET AWAY FROM THAT <strong>!$@*ING</strong> COMPUTER!&#8221; (or something along those lines) more than once. Even if you haven&#8217;t, you might have heard it from your mum when you were a budding geek (as I was).</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34990" title="Reiser4 inventor arrested for murder" target="_blank">this article on The Inquirer</a> I couldn&#8217;t help but think that this bloke had hard that phrase possibly one too many times?!</p>

<p>All joking aside, it&#8217;s quite shocking to think that someone like this could possibly have done something pretty nasty like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes this is old news to anyone who reads any form of news :) But Google have bought YouTube! How exciting. Personally, I&#8217;m very happy for those lads who set YouTube up in the first place. The idea was based on the need to share some large homes videos of parties with mates who weren&#8217;t there, and it&#8217;s turned into a multi-billion dollar empire. It&#8217;s good to hear that there are people out there like this still making something big for themselves for having the balls to give it a go.</p>

<p>On a slightly more sour note, it looks like the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35026" target="_blank">lawsuits</a> will start queuing up. Everyone with any connection to some of the &#8220;unauthorised&#8221; content on YouTube will probably join the long line of would-be beneficiaries from sueing Google/YouTube for breach of copyright. Let&#8217;s hope that this kind of thing is nipped in the bud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Inquirer has posted up some info on the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35057" title="Microsoft Vista licence restrictions hit hardware hard" target="_blank">Microsoft Vista licence restrictions</a> and boy does it sound awful. Not only will it cost you an arm and a leg to buy it, you&#8217;ll probably have to upgrade to get it to run, and after you&#8217;ve upgraded you&#8217;ll probably never be allowed to upgrade again - otherwise you&#8217;ll need a new copy of Vista!</p>

<p>So, you&#8217;re screwed in more ways than one. Every bit of news I&#8217;m hearing about Vista is scaring me at the moment. I really can&#8217;t see why MS are taking the stance their taking and forcing such a pile-o-poop on its customers. If it goes the way their previous licence handling has gone (see my prior blog post on issues with Office Activation), then this is just going to be a hindrance to the honest paying customer, and the hackers are the ones who&#8217;ll have it easy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be sticking with XP, Gentoo and Ubuntu! MS can take their licencing, their DRM and their snooping and stick it where the sun doesn&#8217;t shine.</p>
