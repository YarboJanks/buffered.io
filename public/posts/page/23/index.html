  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have quite a bit to cover in the gaming world today, and I didn&#8217;t want to create a separate post for each thing so I thought I&#8217;d group them all together.</p>

<p>So to start off with, there&#8217;s been some buzz around town that some &#8220;demo&#8221; PS3s have made a bit of an appearance. The guys at <a href="http://www.ign.com/" title="IGN" target="_blank">IGN</a> have been given a bit of a <a href="http://ps3.ign.com/articles/738/738858p1.html" title="IGN: PlayStation 3 Hands-on" target="_blank">hands-on session with the PS3</a>! It&#8217;s hard to call <em>bullshit</em> when there&#8217;s photos of dudes playing the console, so I&#8217;ll hold myself back for now ;) The article is quite interesting, and in my (humble) opinion doesn&#8217;t really give the PS3 a resounding thumbs up.</p>

<p>Firstly, the &#8220;demo&#8221; didn&#8217;t really clear up many of the questions the guys had:<blockquote>Interface-wise, we&#8217;ve still got a lot of unanswered questions. For example, what happens when you stick a DVD, PS1 or PS2 disc in the machine? Well, as of right now nothing - the debug unit Sony&#8217;s demoed to us still features slightly outdated firmware, meaning the machine flatly refuses to play anything other than Blu-Ray discs. Similarly, all attempts to connect our PSPs and Cyber-shot digi-cams to the console were met with resounding indifference. However, we&#8217;ll be getting our hands on an updated version of the machine imminently, so rest assured we&#8217;ll be probing even deeper next time around.</blockquote>Rest assured? Hrm, yeah right. Don&#8217;t think that the &#8220;next time round&#8221; will result in a great deal more information if it&#8217;s any time soon. Since they didn&#8217;t really have a great deal to cover given that the system was a demo system, they focussed a bit on the controller:<blockquote>Instead of duplicating that, we&#8217;ll take a look at one last thing - possibly the most controversial aspect of the PS3: the controller. Prepare to be shocked though: we don&#8217;t really like it all that much. True enough, you can go along with Phil Harrison&#8217;s proclamation that it&#8217;s already the industry-standard controller amongst umpteen-million gamers around the globe, but, arguably, that doesn&#8217;t make it the best. Personally, we can&#8217;t help but feel that the SIXAXIS (as it&#8217;s now known) has been sadly neglected when viewed alongside the rest of the PS3. Compared to Microsoft&#8217;s uber-comfortable Xbox 360 pad, the SIXAXIS feels cheap, plasticky, uncomfortable and disconcertingly light - almost as if it&#8217;s going to fly out of your hands during those more extreme gaming moments.</blockquote>So they&#8217;ve well and truly borked it! Nice work considering that the big selling point for the Wii was the controller - right now, if I were Sony I&#8217;d be nailing my controller designer to the fence. There&#8217;s a stack more to it than what I&#8217;ve quoted, and I&#8217;m not going to quote any more in case they pissed off with me reproducing parts of the article, so get over there and have a read.</p>

<p>Basically, this confirmd my thoughts on the PS3 - it&#8217;s JAGC (just another games console). Nothing that they&#8217;ve done is really going to blow my skirt up. The games will be the same games with the same style of play on a bigger, shinier and noiser box. Sure the GFX and number of bananas on screen might have increased, but it&#8217;s the same shit different look. I know I won&#8217;t be investing my cash in one for a very long time, if at all.</p>

<p>Now for something totally different - a review of a <a href="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=23483&p=1" title="The UK's First Long Wii Play Session - Report - Entertainment News, Reviews, Competitions - Entertainmentwise" target="_blank">hefty Wii gaming session</a>, which is a total switcheroo compared to the S3. The feeling I get from this review is that which I already felt for the Wii - <strong>fun fun fun!</strong> One question that many people are keen to know the answer to is whether or not the Wii controller is going to force you to break a sweat and collapse due to the amount of activity. Those lazy bastards out there will be glad to know, it looks like you don&#8217;t have to be fit and active to wield the Wii controller for extended periods of time:<blockquote>To test this, in terms of fitness we took along two regular gamers with average to low fitness and one gamer with ME/CFS.  He was able to play for the two hour slot with only a fractional tiredness issue and was if anything, making the largest motions with the remote controller out of all three of us and owned at Wii tennis!  If you have health related concerns that you or your friends and family suffer from a tiredness health problem, its not going to bar you from enjoying the Nintendo Wii.  Weve tested it now and after two hours, its safe to say that its possible to play on the Wii launch line up for two hours and not be dripping with sweat afterwards.  Just remember that large body motions are not a requirement  theyre what players do to have fun with the game.  Playing with smaller movements or sitting down is largely possible, doable and healthy.</blockquote>Interesting! That should get the whole family going :) I&#8217;ll resist temptation to regurgitate the entire article, so I&#8217;ll just finish off with: <strong>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!</strong></p>

<p>The next point I&#8217;d like to cover is that of distribution in the games industry. For quite some time, the big companies such as EA have managed to, shall we say, &#8220;acquire&#8221; shelf-space on a fairly regular basis with the large stores like Walmart and EB Games. Needless to say this has made the issue of distribution a huge mountain to climb for those companies who are trying to get a foothold in the market. I&#8217;ll do my best not to imply that there&#8217;s a shifty deal going on between the big producers and distributors (;)) and instead focus on the solution to the problem. The best way to describe it is to give the best known example to date: <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steam Powered" target="_blank">Valve&#8217;s Steam</a>. What a fabulous idea! Online distributin of games and their content was always going to be the next step, and with Steam it&#8217;s really easy. It&#8217;s already been used to great success for games such as Half-Life 2, The Ship and Psyconauts, and it looks like the bigger fish are starting to flock to the feeding frenzy with titles such as Call of Duty and Dark Messiah. As time goes by, more and more games shops will end up with bare shelves because the cost of physical distribution through boxes and CDs just won&#8217;t be worth the effort.  I take my hat off to Valve for this step - not just because they&#8217;ve done a great job with the solution (which did have a few teething problems), but because they&#8217;re sharing the wealth with the other devs. Sure they&#8217;re going to get a piece of every game sold through Steam, but they&#8217;re not trying to use their muscle to drown out the other players in the industry which I think is a great thing.</p>

<p>If the above information doesn&#8217;t get you excited, then surely the thought of seeing <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35094" title="Unreal Engine 3 on Steam and Sonic gets physics" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 3 on Steam</a> should surely raise the eyebrows. A bit more evidence of its success can be found <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34148" title="Three coups up for Valve" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

<p>I also think Microsoft with their <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/livearcade/default.htm" title="Live Arcade" target="_blank">Xbox Live Arcade</a> system are going to do very well. Opening up <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx" title="XNA" target="_blank>XNA</a> to the masses (via <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/gse/" title="Game Studio Express" target="_blank">Game Studio Express</a>) and allowing people to create their own games for sale on the Arcade mechanism opens up the floor to innovation - something that the larger game development companies no longer strive for.</p>

<p>Right, let&#8217;s wrap up with a few more nuggets of jolly goodness. That fun-filled pair <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_%26_Max_Hit_the_Road" title="Sam and Max Hit the Road" target="_blank">Sam &amp; Max</a> are making a return in <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35170" title="Sam &amp; Max ride again" target="_blank">Sam &amp; Max ride again</a>. The original game was just awesome, let&#8217;s hope that the developers of this title can back it up (at least a little) :) It looks like there&#8217;s going to be a world-wide release on the 1st of Nov 2006 - keep ya eyes peeled! It should be great.</p>

<p>Last but not least, those lovable folks at EA have decided to douse their clients with spyware that comes bundled with <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35169" title="Battlefield 2142 comes with spyware" target="_blank">Battlefield 2142</a>. How nice! Just make sure you&#8217;re not doing <em>anything</em> at all while you have this game installed and you <em>should</em> be fine. Better still, boycott the game until they remove the spyware - the whole idea of spyware in games is just wrong I think.</p>

<p>So that concludes my little games round-up. If you&#8217;re looking for something else that might be a bit more fun to read after this collection of goodies, perhaps something like <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/columns/hardcore/shadowcast/" title="GameDev.net -- Shadow Caster Volumes For The Culling Of Potential Shadow Casters" target="_blank">this</a> will take your fancy :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php" target="_blank" title="Open Source (OSI) Logo"><img src="http://www.opensource.org/trademarks/opensource/web/opensource-110x95.png" alt="Open Source (OSI) Logo" border="0" width="110" height="95" class="InlineImageRight" /></a>I&#8217;ve been interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software" title="Open Source Software" target="_blank">Open Source Software</a> (OSS) for quite some time now but I&#8217;ve never really attempted to find out much about it, nor how I can contribute. Of course, being a professional developer, the immediate thought is &#8220;I make a living off writing software, so how does that work with Open Source?&#8221;.</p>

<p>After reading all the news about Vista and it&#8217;s attempts to completely revoke my rights as a user, my interest in the OSS movement in general has increased, and I do feel it&#8217;s time for me to not only get a better understanding of what it is and how it works, but how I can contribute to it.</p>

<p>What is it about OSS that makes it work? Is it possible to support yourself and a family off the fruits of your labours if you&#8217;re working in the OSS community? Is it going to provide the challenges I want from my job? Is it a valid model for writing bespoke software as per a client&#8217;s request?</p>

<p>If you ask <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34998" title="Open Source a billion dollar market" target="_blank">The Inquirer</a> they&#8217;ll tell you that:<blockquote>Getting your head around Open Source is a bit easier, and according to Bernard Dalle, from VC firm Index Ventures the movement, if you can still call it a movement, is accelerating like there&#8217;s no tomorrow.</p>

<p>He said there are around 120,000 Open Source projects up and running. &#8220;We&#8217;re not asking ourselves whether we can make money out of open source any more,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And better than that, it&#8217;s &#8220;a billion dollar market, going at a 40 or 50 per cent rate&#8221;.</blockquote>
I don&#8217;t know about you but that sounds pretty darned impressive to me! So how do you get involved?</p>

<p>Looks like there are a few ways :)</p>

<p><strong><u>1. SourceForge</u></strong></p>

<p>Point you browser at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/" title="SourceForge" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>, have a browse through the plethora of OSS projects that are running (trust me, there&#8217;s a <em>shitload</em>), and join in! Most of the time the developers are keen to get help whenever they can. If you find that you&#8217;re stills aren&#8217;t up to date, then you&#8217;re going to have to make an effort to get up to speed before you can contribute.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t find a project that you&#8217;re interested in, or people aren&#8217;t necessarily interested in having you join in, then you can always start your own. You don&#8217;t have to find something that noone else is doing, all you have to do is come up with something you&#8217;d be interested in working on, and ask the guys at SF.net to set up a project for you. Then you&#8217;re in full control, and you can begin work straight away.</p>

<p><strong><u>2. Just go it Alone</u></strong></p>

<p>This is always a viable option, but people tend to &#8220;die out&#8221; when doing things this way. Get your own web space, and set up the development project yourself. It takes a pretty dedicated person to go through this kind of development task by themselves and see it through to the end without getting any help along the way.  I think that if you want to make sure you keep on track, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to try to get a few people to work with you, otherwise you may find that your motivation starts to drop and you don&#8217;t end up finishing (which is the bane of many programmers).</p>

<p><strong><u>3. Sign up for Contract OSS Work</u></strong></p>

<p>I stumbled across this idea via the Larkware Site (see &#8220;Sites for Geeks&#8221; on the right) and thought it was pretty neat.  There&#8217;s a site currently being built which, by the looks of it, is designed to be a hub and a resource for employers and developers writing OSS. The site is called <a href="http://www.assembla.com/" title="Assembla" target="_blank">Assembla</a>, and is currently in the throws of being set up properly, though it looks like there is at least some form of collaboration and linking mechanism up there.  This could well be a way for potential OSS developers to get involved with a company <em>anywhere in the world</em> and aid them in building OSS. What a great idea!!  To pouch a snippet from the site:<blockquote>We take the best practices from <strong>open source</strong> and <strong>agile methodologies</strong>, and <strong>distributed teams</strong> and adapt them for commercial software development. It&#8217;s not typical contracting or outsourcing, but a third way that gets you the best talent available in the world, exactly when you need it, as part of a single global team. So, take advantage of our free development workspaces for distributed teams, advertise yourself as a developer, apply to work on Assembla projects, or get fast, full-service development and launch.</blockquote></p>

<p><strong><u>4. Use your Imagination</u></strong></p>

<p>The point here is, the concept of OSS is pretty simple, so you could create software, zip up the source and send it to people through spam if you really wanted to :) The limit is your imagination, so use it! There are a stack of other ways you can get involved, and there&#8217;s really nothing stopping you.</p>

<p><strong><u>A Common Misconception</u></strong></p>

<p>OSS doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean free, and free doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean OSS. It&#8217;s important to get an understanding of the difference between the two. Also, it&#8217;s fairly common for naive devs to think that you can&#8217;t write OSS on a Windows platform due to the nature of MS - again, that&#8217;s wrong. The software you create you can do whatever the hell you want with - if that includes releasing the source to the masses, then so be it. Be careful though, if you&#8217;re writing software for a client and they&#8217;re <em>paying</em> you to write it for them, make sure that you own the IP or there is a clause in your contract that states that you&#8217;re able to release the source if you want to before you actually do it. The last thing you want is to have a law suit on your hands.</p>

<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>

<p>My knowledge of OSS is pretty limited, but from reading around the web and speaking to some mates who are in on it, I&#8217;m finding that I&#8217;m getting quite excited about it. It not only sounds interesting, but it looks like fun as well! A good start would be to get familiar with some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license" title="Open Source Licence" target="_blank">licencing</a> models such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" title="GPL" target="_blank">GPL</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License" title="LGPL" target="_blank">LGPL</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Public_License" title="APL" target="_blank">APL</a>.</p>

<p>So, if there are devs out there wasting time by reading blogs such as this ;) Get off ya butts and start contributing, you never know where it may take you! I for one will be scouting the options for something to contribute to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, so it looks like I might have been misinformed (er&#8230; wrong :)) by stating that the basic versions of Vista can&#8217;t be installed on VMs. That&#8217;ll teach me not to read the licencing details properly myself! It looks like it was a slight misunderstanding of the terms and structure that MS used in stating the rules. I won&#8217;t go into the details myself since <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=157" title="No, theres no ban on virtual Vista" target="_blank">Ed Bott has already done it for me</a>. So, MS <em>haven&#8217;t</em> shot themselves in the foot in this regard, but they still seem to be doing it in other ways.</p>

<p>One of those ways, which is now 100% confirmed, is that you can only move your installation of Vista to a different machine (read: different hardware) <strong>once and once <em>only</em></strong>. Again, this is confirmed courtesty of <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=156" title="A sneaky change in Windows licensing terms" target="_blank">Ed Bott</a>. Instead of being able to reinstall when you buy a new mobo, and then reinstall again after you buy a new CPU, you may well have to fork out for another Vista licence due to the hardware change. What a lovely feature!</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s chat (via previous post on Vista) with Bryce got me thinking about what other peoples&#8217; thoughts were regarding the whole stance MS are taking with Vista, and during my searches I found <a href="http://www.computerpoweruser.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/c0611/44c11/44c11.asp&guid=8CF5E5CB35CB42E1857F6F42970E2A2C" title="Vista Will Double Apples Market Share" target="_blank">this post by Chris Pirillo</a> (a long-time MS user) which covers his views on said topic. It&#8217;s quite an interesting read :) He also took a bit of time to post on his blog after writing the article to cover some <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/posts/microsoft-windows-vista-vs-apple-os-x/" title="Microsoft Windows Vista vs. Apple OS X" target="_blank">other points</a>, again well worth reading.  It&#8217;s good to see another long-term MS user with the balls to speak out loud and say that Macs are becoming more appealing by the day.  I agree with him when he says that MS isn&#8217;t really making this a difficult decision to make.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of Macs, partly because I never had to use them and Windows was familiar, but as time goes by I&#8217;m rethinking my position. I keep saying that there&#8217;s not enough software out there for me to make the move to Mac (and Linux), but not I&#8217;m thinking that I need to make the switch and become one of the developers that can help sort that problem out :D</p>

<p>So, sorry about my stuff up, but it doesn&#8217;t really improve my view of Vista by much anyway!</p>

The <a href="http://google.com/codesearch" title="Code Search" target="_blank">Google Code Search</a> is quite a cool utility - but it doesn&#8217;t come without it&#8217;s issues. I found an interesting link worthy of reading which talks about a few <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/google-code-search" target="_blank">amusing results</a> returned from this facility, which I reckon lots of people should check out and be aware of.</p>

<p>So this begs the question: Is this going to be a tool which allows hackers to get acceess to bugs in software a heck of a lot quicker? I believe so. Is that a bad thing? No, I don&#8217;t think so. In fact, it&#8217;ll teach developers (the hard way) that they need to be aware of security issues well before they release the code - which can only be a good thing as it should have a positive affect on the software.</p>

<p>As a small side note, there can also be some <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/posts/code_outrage/" title="Apple in code search profanity outrage" target="_blank">embarrassing snippets</a> revealed which will make the big names cringe. So, maybe this will also teach developers to be a little more professional!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And so the Vista malarky continues! More and more details of the behemoth that is Vista are coming to light which, quite frankly, freak me out even more.</p>

<p>First of all, <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/2006/10/microsoft-denies-some-vista-editions.html" target="_blank" title="virtualization.info: Microsoft denies some Vista editions to run virtualized">Microsoft won&#8217;t let you run some Vista editions virtualised</a>, which is a bit of a surprise. Why would they push for free Virtual PC software and then not let you use some basic versions of the new OS under such a set up?</p>

<p>Secondly, despite there being large support for a 3D desktop, the coverage in the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35084" title="Vista RC 2 gaming with Nvidia not there yet" target="_blank">game area is lacking</a>. WTF is going on here? So we&#8217;re going to make it hard for the gamers to move over as well? This is just unbelievable.</p>

<p>I think that <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=227f20b1-adfe-4361-b776-111a7069f622" title="From 9 till 2 - Vista the Adventure Game" target="_blank">this</a> nugget of genius sums it up nicely :) This will hit home for those who have spent any time in text-based adventure games and/or MUDs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I shouldn&#8217;t laugh about this, but I couldn&#8217;t help it :)</p>

<p>Any geek that&#8217;s in a relationship has probably heard the words &#8220;GET AWAY FROM THAT <strong>!$@*ING</strong> COMPUTER!&#8221; (or something along those lines) more than once. Even if you haven&#8217;t, you might have heard it from your mum when you were a budding geek (as I was).</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34990" title="Reiser4 inventor arrested for murder" target="_blank">this article on The Inquirer</a> I couldn&#8217;t help but think that this bloke had hard that phrase possibly one too many times?!</p>

<p>All joking aside, it&#8217;s quite shocking to think that someone like this could possibly have done something pretty nasty like this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You&#8217;ve probably all guessed by now that I&#8217;m a bit of a <a href="http://www.dilbert.com" title="Dilbert" target="_blank">Dilbert</a> fan, especially considering that it feels like a I work with most of those characters!</p>

<p>While browsing through the recent cartoons, I noticed that there was a link to <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/" title="The Dilbert Blog" target="_blank">Scott Adam&#8217;s Blog</a> which I proceeded to follow and I was greeted with some really interesting reading. So if you&#8217;ve got some time to kill and are interested in getting into the amazing mind of the man behind Dilbert, get on over there and have a read!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes this is old news to anyone who reads any form of news :) But Google have bought YouTube! How exciting. Personally, I&#8217;m very happy for those lads who set YouTube up in the first place. The idea was based on the need to share some large homes videos of parties with mates who weren&#8217;t there, and it&#8217;s turned into a multi-billion dollar empire. It&#8217;s good to hear that there are people out there like this still making something big for themselves for having the balls to give it a go.</p>

<p>On a slightly more sour note, it looks like the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35026" target="_blank">lawsuits</a> will start queuing up. Everyone with any connection to some of the &#8220;unauthorised&#8221; content on YouTube will probably join the long line of would-be beneficiaries from sueing Google/YouTube for breach of copyright. Let&#8217;s hope that this kind of thing is nipped in the bud.</p>
