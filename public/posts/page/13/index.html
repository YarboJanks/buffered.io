He&#8217;s a fairly well-known guy, particularly in the heroic fantasty and sci-fi circles. His name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gemmell" title="David Gemmell">David Gemmell</a>, and this post is a mini dedication to him and his career.</p>

<p>I first discovered the joys of David&#8217;s writing when a dear friend of mine, Simon C, allowed me to borrow one of his books. It was called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Legend-David-Gemmell/dp/0345913779/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196748787&sr=1-1" title="Legend">Legend</a>, and it was a fascinating and enthralling story. If I remember correctly, it took me but a couple of days of after school reading to get throug it. It was easy reading. The kind of book that you just don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to put down.</div>

Today is my first ever wedding anniversary! This last year seems to have <em>flown</em> by. In many ways it feels like I got married a few weeks ago, and yet in other ways it feels like so much has happened.</p>

<p>It really has been an amazing year. I&#8217;m an extremely lucky man and honestly couldn&#8217;t be happier. I won&#8217;t get too sooky, but I just wanted to say that my wife makes my life complete. One year down, <strong>many</strong> more to go!</p>

<p>On a sad note, today our Government changed and the ALP are now in power. I&#8217;ve already mentioned that I despise Rudd the dickhe&#8230; I mean ministers that work with him. The thought of giving Wayne Swann the job of managing the economy just makes me sick to the stomach. I just hope that I&#8217;m wrong about Kevin, and that he&#8217;s actually going to do a good job. By the same token, I hope he can&#8217;t do much damage in the next three years while he&#8217;s in office.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This may come as a surprise, but living in Australia <em>can</em> have it downsides :) Right now I can only think of one, and that&#8217;s (part of) the reason for this post.</p>

<p>We may have constant sunshine, lovely beaches and a lifestyle to die for, but our broadband just <strong>sucks</strong>. That&#8217;s a fairly sweeping statement, so let me clarify a little more.</p>

<p>Broadband plans in this country are <em>extremely</em> poor value. The service that you receive for the amount you pay is substandard. It&#8217;s that simple. Those of you in places like the UK, USA and Hong Kong may find it obscure to consider that a country exists where you can&#8217;t get an unlimited data connection for DSL. You may also find it difficult to believe that some connection speeds are cut to that of a dial-up connection if you download too much. But that&#8217;s exactly what happens here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most people who trundle through life, battling against the elements and working hard to achieve at work or in the home find that they need an escape. I&#8217;m not talking about just a holiday to the <a href="http://www.whitsundaytourism.com/" title="Whitsundays">Whitsundays</a> or a month off to go hiking in the Himalayas. I&#8217;m talking about something more regular. Something that perhaps you can do on a daily basis to help you feel more relaxed.</p>

<p>I have a few. I like to do distance running. At the moment my training regime is almost non-existant because of the stuff that&#8217;s going on, but that&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to remedy shortly. I&#8217;m going to go for runs during lunchtimes again now that I&#8217;m somewhere which has a clean shower! I find that a good long run can really make me feel good. Nothing like a bit of cardio excercise followed by a hit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphin" title="Endorphin">endorphins</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started my new gig on the 15th of this month, I was handed a <a href="http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/cmod.to?coid=-33778" title="Toshiba Tecra M9">new laptop</a> to do all my work on. It&#8217;s a nifty little gadget with 3GB RAM! Very schmick. There was one catch..</p>

<p>&#8230; see, the company is migrating to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/default.mspx" title="Windows Vista">Vista</a>, which means I have to use it too. A while ago I <a href="/posts/should-i-install-vista/" title="Should I install Vista?">posted my thoughts with regards to installing Vista</a>, so as you can imagine it&#8217;s a little bit strange having to use it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the last time I posted a couple of things have happened that are worth mentioning.</p>

<p>First of all, my dear mate <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/" title="Shiftperception">Dan</a> and his lovely girl, Ailin, <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/were-married/" title="We're Married!">got married on the 6th October</a>. It was a fantastic day and I was honoured to be part of it!</p>

<p>Second, I started a new job. A little while ago I received an offer that was too good to miss, and I decided to make the jump. It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision (it never is), but I do think it&#8217;s the right one. As usual, I&#8217;m not going to mention where I am, nor where I came from. But I can at least pass on a few details.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m about to break a cardinal rule. I&#8217;m going to talk about politics (but only briefly). If you&#8217;re not Australian, or don&#8217;t have an interest in Australian politics, I&#8217;d suggest you give this post a miss :)</p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m sitting in front of the T.V. watching the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/posts/2060007.htm">Leaders Debate</a>, and I have to say that I&#8217;m appalled at some of the utter dribble that is coming out of Kevin Rudd&#8217;s mouth. The man makes me cringe. He&#8217;s full of piss and wind, and constantly avoids answering questions. He doesn&#8217;t really ever say anything of substance. All he seems to do is try and pick holes in the current government. He&#8217;s an abhorrent little man, and I would be embarrassed to have him lead my country.</p>

<p>Dear God, please don&#8217;t let Labour win!</p>

<p>PS. I promise I&#8217;ll never post on politics again! :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In recent weeks I&#8217;ve seen interesting patterns of traffic to the site. I have been trying to figure out exactly what leads people here, but it has been a hard thing to put a finger on (despite the amazing functionality of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>). I had a sneaking suspicion for a while that I&#8217;ve been getting hits from those people who are looking for information on OJ Simpson. Two days ago that was confirmed.</p>

<p>I fired up Analytics, and noticed a traffic spike that coincided with the recent arrest of Mr Simpson after his little &#8220;meeting&#8221; with some thieves. The stats that were listed showed that search engines receiving requests for &#8220;oj&#8221;, &#8220;o.j.&#8221;, etc were dishing up my site as a result.</p>

<p>Let me state for the record: I am <em>not</em> OJ Simpson. But thank you for visiting, and please come again! :)</p>
