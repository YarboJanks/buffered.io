  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a read of Eastabrook&#8217;s blog recently (see a link in the Blogroll) and noticed that he posted about an interesting link that he found.  The link, entitled <a href="http://www.fboweb.com/antest/ge/intro.aspx?old=1" title="Flight Tracking in 3D" target="_blank">Flight Tracking in 3D</a>, shows details of a few downloads that you can grab for <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth" target="_blank">Google Earth</a> which actually show the current locations of <strong>flights that are currently in progress all over the world!!!</strong></p>

<p>Unbelievable. Pretty amazing technology, and at the same time quite scary. What kind of possible security issues does this feature open up?  I know that Google Earth has had these kinds of questions asked in the past, but this to me seems like it&#8217;s taking the issue to a whole new level.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been intending to write about this (and a few other things) for a while now, but due to wedding planning and work I&#8217;ve found it hard to find the time. So I&#8217;ll take the opportunity while my disk is being defragged to crank out some thoughts.</p>

<p>Individual developers vary in many different ways, but I&#8217;ve often wondered what motivates other people and what they consider their job to be. To be more specific, what is it that a developer feels they should be doing in their day job? What does it encompass? Which bits do they worry about, which bits do they not worry about? What is it that they do which makes them what they are?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve met way too many developers who have a very narrow description of their job, and follow that description regardless of the consequences - often to the detriment of the project they&#8217;re working on and the team they&#8217;re working with. Their views on their role often surprise me. So, I&#8217;m going to cover the things that I feel should be part of the job of a developer - and this applies to both contractors and permanent employees.</p>

<p><strong><u>Understanding the Problem</u></strong></p>

<p>How on earth are you supposed to come up with a valid and effecient solution to a problem if you have no idea what the problem is? This is surprisingly common out in the field. Developers can focus so much on the code and the technical aspects of the solution that they don&#8217;t really know (or care) about the problem they&#8217;re trying to solve. How many times have you guys worked with someone who just cranks code out thinking that it&#8217;s adding value to the software when in fact it&#8217;s totally irrelevant? How often have you seen modules implemented that only cover half of the problem? Can you think of a time where a colleague has written some code to solve a problem (which works really well) only to find that the problem they&#8217;ve solved has either already been solved or doesn&#8217;t need to be solved?</p>

<p>Getting an understanding of your problem is the first thing any dev should do. If at all possible, the first implementation that the dev attempts should be thrown away as it&#8217;s generally not the best solution and really should work as a way of gaining a better understanding of the problem.</p>

<p>Developers in general tend not to have a focus on the business side of the software. This is a general statement (because not all people work on software that&#8217;s being built for a particular client or set of clients), but I think it&#8217;s generally true. I&#8217;ve worked with some people who think that the job of understanding the business is purely the responsbility of the B.A., and hence they shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about it. After all, they&#8217;re there to write code! <strong>Rubbish!</strong> Your software is guaranteed to be off target if you don&#8217;t get in the mind of the business users who will end up using the application you&#8217;re working.</p>

<p><strong><u>Know your Tech</u></strong></p>

<p>This is a relatively broad title, so let me explain a little more. What I mean is that developers should have a very good understanding of the target platform, the language(s) that are being used to write the software, and the issues that might be faced when trying to bring these two things together. I truly feel it&#8217;s the responsibility of the developers to <em>stay up to date</em> with advances in technology in their own domain <em>at the very least</em>. Preferrably developers should also have a general knowledge of what&#8217;s going on in <em>all</em> areas of I.T., but since there&#8217;s so much to take in this can be a very hard thing to do.</p>

<p>Example: If you&#8217;re working on a C# application using .NET v1.1 in a web-based environment (so you&#8217;re using ASP.NET) on a MS SQL server database then you have a few things to be on top of:</p>

<ul><li><strong>C#</strong> - The syntax of the language is obviously a pretty important bit ;) but there&#8217;s much more to it than that. Concepts such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/04/net/" title=".NET: An Introduction to Delegates" target="_blank">delegates</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/posts/51371.aspx" title="Interning Strings &amp; Immutability" target="_blank">immutability</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/posts/51371.aspx" title="ref (C#)" target="_blank">ref</a> should be second-nature. Understanding them isn&#8217;t enough, but knowing when and when not to use these features is key as well. Of course, this list isn&#8217;t definitive ;) There&#8217;s lots more to C# than this!</li><li><strong>.NET 1.1</strong> - This covers two areas: .NET (the framework itself) and v1.1 of the framework. Having in-depth knowledge of the whole framework is a mammoth task, and I&#8217;m not suggesting that everyone should be able to recite off the top of their heads the details of all the classes in the framework. The framework is pretty extensive, but despite that developers still seem to hand-code a lot of stuff that&#8217;s already part of the framework - which isn&#8217;t a particularly good use of time or resources. On top of understanding the framework, keeping abreast of the known issues of the framework version along with the improvements that were made over previous versions is important as well as it will allow you to make the most of the supporting libraries you have available.</li><li><strong>ASP.NET</strong> - This is a whole can of worms all by itself. It can be a hairy beast to work with if your knowledge of it is lacking and hence getting up to speed with it is very important if you&#8217;re going to be working on a project that utilises it. Some examples of bits that should be understood are issues surrounding state management, session management, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/viewstate.asp" title="Understanding the ASP.NET View State" target="_blank">View State</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178472.aspx" title="ASP.NET Page Life-Cycle Overview" target="_blank">page life cycle</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconASPNETAuthentication.asp" title="ASP.NET Authentication" target="_blank">authentication</a>. There&#8217;s a lot to get through, and it&#8217;s hard to make a decent web-based .NET application without having a thorough grasp of how it all works. I&#8217;m still stunned at how often I come across development teams who are using ASP.NET and still don&#8217;t really know some of the basics which would allow them to write better applications with fewer bugs - all they need to do is a bit of research/reading, but it just doesn&#8217;t happen.</li><li><strong>MS SQL</strong> - This is another point that covers two areas: MS SQL as a technology, and connecting <em>to</em> MS SQL from your application code. In this example, knowing <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/learning/adonet/" title="Learning ADO.NET" target="_blank">ADO.NET</a> is a given, but having a better understanding of some <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/05/DataPoints/" title="Data Access Strategies Using ADO.NET and SQL" target="_blank">strategies</a> behind using it more effectively would improve the quality of the application. Lastly, getting to grips with <a href="http://www.devguru.com/technologies/sqlsyntax/quickref/sql_syntax_intro.html" title="SQL Syntax Introduction" target="_blank">Transact-SQL syntax</a> is a good starting point for making the most of MS SQL. However, rather than just knowing how to write queries to pull data out, developers should get familiar with some of the best practices and common pitfalls when using the database in a production environment.</li></ul>


<p>In a nutshell, what I&#8217;m saying is: developers get their hands dirty with new tech, and then when they feel they know enough they simply throw themselves into the development work without making sure they&#8217;re doing what <em>should</em> be done with the technologies they&#8217;re utilising. Knowing the syntax of C# isn&#8217;t enough. Knowing that ASP.NET is a web-based &#8220;thingy&#8221; isn&#8217;t enough. Having MS SQL as a DB and writing queries isn&#8217;t enough. In order to write good and robust applications which aren&#8217;t a nightmare to maintain, developers should do a heck of a lot more than just scratch the surface of the learning iceberg before they start development.</p>

<p><strong><u>Stay up to Date</u></strong></p>

<p>Technology, software development and practices are constantly changing. Sure it&#8217;s not always positive, but most of the time the changes are a move forward. Developers should be making an effort to stay in touch with these changes, and take what they can from them. Utilise new ideas and technologies where it makes sense. Keep up to speed with what&#8217;s going on in the industry to make sure that you don&#8217;t slip behind your competition. Clients aren&#8217;t just looking for a solution, they&#8217;re looking for a solution that&#8217;s going to last. Using the most up to date practices and technologies <em>should</em> help you achieve that.</p>

<p>As a final point on this issue: being up to date is going to make you more marketable as a software professional should you wish to move on! :)</p>

<p><strong><u>Share your Knowledge</u></strong></p>

<p>Software Development isn&#8217;t a <strong>black art</strong> that should be kept secret so that your value is increased and your job is made secure. Knowledge of best practices, technology nuances, and business process is something that would benefit not only every developer on the team, but the team as a whole (including managers, analysts and testers). Teams should strive to share as much knowledge as they can, as it&#8217;s only going to benefit the software in the long term - and after all, isn&#8217;t writing <em>good and valuable</em> software the goal here?</p>

<p>Sharing knowledge in itself can be an issue, and some methods work in one team which might not work in another. However, I do think there&#8217;s a stack of options to aid in achieving this. Here are a few:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" title="Wiki" target="_blank">Wiki</a></strong> - Use it and use it <em>often</em>. Dump your thoughts, keep a developer diary, write down every annoying little piece of information you may find that you think could help someone else in the future. Wikis often become a hub of information and an amazingly valuable resource. Their value can be proven time and time again when new members join the team and need to get up to speed with the project. More importantly, when team members leave they don&#8217;t end up taking with them the only knowledge of a certain part of a system because the details are all on the wiki. I&#8217;m a big wiki advocate and I can&#8217;t think of any case where a wiki isn&#8217;t of value (feel free to prove me wrong :)).</li><li><strong>Code Documentation</strong> - Yes, this isn&#8217;t always going to happen ;) But I can dream can&#8217;t I? Utilising applications such as <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net/" title="NDoc" target="_blank">NDoc</a> and <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/" title="Doxygen" target="_blank">Doxygen</a> will allow for automatic document generation from the source code. Of course this will rely on the developers maintaining the code appropriately so that meaningful documentation can be created, but this <em>should</em> be part of a team&#8217;s coding standard anyway.</li><li><strong>Stand-up Meetings</strong> - This is something that is utilised a lot in Agile methodologies (such as <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/" title="Extreme Programming" target="_blank">XP</a>) and can have great value so long as the team members all contribute appropriately. Stand-ups encourage interaction on a daily basis, and can aid in communication and knowledge sharing. Each team member can talk about what they did the day before, and what they hope to do on the current day. Discussion of issues faced can arise, and other developers can comment on possible solutions or known issues with the code-base which can help other team members do their job more efficiently.</li><li><strong>Others</strong> - There are others, but I&#8217;m going to stop here or I&#8217;ll never get this rant finished :)</li></ul>


<p><strong><u>Be Up-Beat</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve lost count of the amount of &#8220;disgruntled&#8221; employees I&#8217;ve had to work with. Most of them seem grumpy for no apparent reason (ie. they just have issues with the world), and it doesn&#8217;t help promote open communication in the team. I think developers should learn to leave their personal issues at home and come to work fresh and ready to take on the challenges of the day. If yesterday was frustrating and counter-productive, don&#8217;t come to work grizzling about how bad it was - come in with renewed determination to nail the issue and move on.</p>

<p><strong><u>Don&#8217;t Pass the Buck</u></strong></p>

<p>This is going to be another generalisation, but humour me for the point of this discussion :) As time goes by and developers (particularly permanent employees) get comfortable at work, they can start to form their own little working worlds that they don&#8217;t want to venture out of. This is where you find most of the nominees of the renowned &#8220;Not My Job&#8221; awards. As a developer, your job is to be a problem solver! That means solving the problem regardless of the business unit, language, technology, platform or application. If there&#8217;s a bug in a stored procedure that you didn&#8217;t write, don&#8217;t assume that it&#8217;s the author&#8217;s responsibility to fix it. If one of the other teams in your organisation has an issue, don&#8217;t stick your head in the sand and let them deal with it themselves when you, as a fresh pair of eyes, could possibly help them sort it out quicker.</p>

<p>As a team member it&#8217;s important to understand that the problem doesn&#8217;t belong to an individual member of the team, it belongs to the team as a whole - even if the problem arises due to someone making a mistake. Get in there and fix it! After all, isn&#8217;t fixing stuff like that part of the fun of being a developer?</p>

<p><strong><u>Be Open to Ideas</u></strong></p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re the application&#8217;s &#8220;star developer&#8221;; it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re the known &#8220;guru&#8221; of a particular language; it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;ve worked with technology X for 15x10<sup>32</sup> years; you can always learn something from other people. Listen to what they have to say, and see how you utilise their ideas in your own work. Two heads are (generally) better than one, and mixing ideas and listening to suggestions from other team members (yes, even if they&#8217;re junior, fresh out of college or consider to be crap!) can really have a positive effect on what you&#8217;re working on.</p>

<p>Rank is of no importance here. Lead or junior, permy or contractor. An awesome idea can strike at any time from anywhere! So be open to it.</p>

<p><strong><u>Don&#8217;t Settle for Hacks or Quick Fixes</u></strong></p>

<p>Unfortunatley this rule can&#8217;t be applied all the time (which is a shame), but it can be applied <em>most</em> of the time. Too often have we all seen cases where people quickly fix something because it needs to be &#8220;done&#8221; for a given iteration or release only to find that it lives on well after its intended death date. It rears its ugly head to bite the team in the arse over and over again.</p>

<p>Your job as a professional developer means that you don&#8217;t just have the job of building a bit of functionality. You should be making sure you do it <em>well</em>. You should make it as robust as you can while using good programming practices and structures so that future maintainers of the software don&#8217;t have a hernia at the though of working on the code every time a user logs a new bug.</p>

<p>This kind of thing will always happen, particularly in the later phases of development (such is the nature of the development beast), but I personally feel that there is no excuse for it when building an application prior to its first release. Fix it now, and fix it <em>properly</em>. Stop hacking and slashing. You know it makes sense!</p>

<p><strong><u>Fix the Problem, not the Symptoms</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to use an analogy here that a friend of mine uses all the time which I really like :)</p>

<p>A bunch of developers are sitting around a table that has a dead cat on it. The cat&#8217;s been dead for at least 3 days and it&#8217;s really starting to pong. It&#8217;s in pieces, it&#8217;s messy, and nobody wants to touch it. The developers are all sitting there fanning themselves trying to get fresh air and wondering how they can go about getting rid of the stench.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Let&#8217;s use some air freshener!&#8221;</em> says one developer.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;No, we need to get a new air-conditioner that can circulate the air faster.&#8221;</em> says another.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just move the desk into the corner and sit in the opposite corner.&#8221;</em> says a third.</p>

<p>Of course, what they should be doing is putting the gloves on and undertaking the messy task of getting rid of the dead cat - entrails and all!</p>

<p>Some jobs in development can be like this. You know that fixing the symptom(s) of the problem would be easy, but the underlying cause of the problem is still there. My opinion: <strong>do your job!</strong> Fix the problem instead of alleviating the symptoms. Chances are that if you don&#8217;t, those symptoms (and others) will arise in other areas of the application which you&#8217;ll end up having to &#8220;fix&#8221; anyway. The overall time that it takes to cover the symptoms, along with the negative affect on the code, really isn&#8217;t worth it in the long run. It&#8217;s your job to do it properly.</p>

<p><strong><u>Stick to your Guns</u></strong></p>

<p>Sometimes we all come across someone who refuses to listen, or doesn&#8217;t like your idea because <em>you</em> came up with it and not them. Remember, your job is to add value, solve problems and do your tasks <strong>properly</strong> regardless of other team members&#8217; issues. If you know you&#8217;re idea is going to add value to the current context then don&#8217;t back down on it because other people are more senior, more known, or more intimidating than you.</p>

<p><strong><u>Take Ownership and Responsibility</u></strong></p>

<p>Your time at work is paid for by someone other than you! So while you&#8217;re there you should be adding value at the very least. Don&#8217;t approach your tasks with a &#8220;won&#8217;t be my problem&#8221; attitude. The problem is yours, the software is yours and you should take full responsibility and ownership of what you are working on as if it was going to be with you for the rest of your days. Too many devs (especially contractors) write code knowing that they&#8217;re not going to be &#8220;stuck&#8221; with it when they&#8217;re done. This is a bad attitude to have, and it&#8217;ll result in your reputation slowly turning bad. It&#8217;s your development duty to aim longer term, and to treat other people&#8217;s problems as your own.</p>

<p><strong><u>That&#8217;s all folks!</u></strong></p>

<p>So, there&#8217;s a <em>small</em> summary of what I think it is that makes up the job of the developer :) I think it&#8217;ll vary compared to lots of other people&#8217;s, but I think that in general we have a lot more responsibility than most people are prepared to take on.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another quick note today (it&#8217;s late, and I need to sleep :)), and again it&#8217;s VIM related.  The dude that made ViEmu that I mentioned a couple of days back has come up with <a href="http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-sql-server-management-studio.html" title="ViEmu SQL" target="_blank">another plugin</a> - this time for SQL Server 2005 Managment Studio. It weighs in at a hefty USD$99.95 which, in my opinion, is quite a hefty price tag just to be able to write SQL in VIM. You can get both for USD$139 which saves you USD$30 on the two, but again I feel that&#8217;s a bit much for what you get. Sure I&#8217;m becoming a bigger fan of VIM by the day, but I doubt I&#8217;ll consider buying anything more than the Visual Studio integration.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be having a rant about what I think a developer wants from his day job (or perhaps what I think he/she <em>should</em> want ;)).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After all my ranting and raving on what I think would be awesome to have as an IDE, I somehow stumbled across exactly what I was trying to describe. <a href="http://www.viemu.com/" title="ViEmu" target="_blank">ViEmu</a> looks to be the perfect combination of VIM and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Well, I did get very excited when I saw it and so I downloaded and installed it. I&#8217;ve only had a play for an hour or so, and by the looks of it it&#8217;s very close to what I&#8217;m picturing in my mind&#8217;s eye. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s bang on though - and for the princely sum of USD $69.95 it&#8217;d better be bang on before I invest my beans into it :) It does feel a little different, but I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not quite the same as VIM or because it&#8217;s suffering from being inside a Visual Studio environment. Thankfully I&#8217;ve got 30 days to play with it and get a good idea before having to purchase.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;ll take my time and I&#8217;ll let you know what I think. Hopefully by the time the trial period is up I&#8217;ll not only have a good idea as to whether or not this fits the bill, but I&#8217;ll also be better with the VIM commands in general.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have pondered this question since long before I graduated from University. I&#8217;ve worked with a mix of degree-qualified and self-taught people, and I&#8217;m still yet to nail the answer.</p>

<p>Being degree-qualified or self-taught both have their pros and cons, but at the end of the day I think that the person who has a good mix of both sides is the one that&#8217;s going to stand out. If you&#8217;re keen to make a go of your career then you should want to give yourself the best chance of getting work in the field by studying it formally at University. If you&#8217;re passionate about what you&#8217;re getting yourself into, then you&#8217;ll probably put extra time aside to learn the things that either don&#8217;t or won&#8217;t come up when studying formally.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from University, but not necessarily the things that I use while at work. I felt that Uni was a necessary step to give me a grounding and a level of understanding of things that I could build on when working professionally. I don&#8217;t feel that Uni covered every aspect, and I certainly don&#8217;t feel that the all aspects it did cover were covered sufficiently. I think that going to Uni helps by:</p>

<ul><li>Forcing you to study (and pass) subjects that you won&#8217;t like. Noone goes through Uni loving every single subject they studied, there&#8217;s always at least one that you just despise. Even though it&#8217;s a pain, you have to finish the subject and pass it to graduate. I think this is some proof to potential employers that you can face boring tasks and still finish them with a respectable level of quality.</li><li>Teaching you to learn. This isn&#8217;t something that school teaches you very well (in my opinion - but that might just be the school I went to :)). I think that being bombarded with a hefty workload while at Uni you learn to manage time a little better, you learn to prioritise and you learn how to learn.</li><li>Proving you can stick to something long term and see it through. Uni can be tough, especially if you&#8217;re working to stay alive during the course of your degree. Sticking at it over a period of years shows that you have what it takes to see something through to the end even though it can be quite challenging.</li><li>Gives you a foundation of knowledge in areas you might not study by yourself. Bachelors degrees tend to try and give you a broad knowledge of your field, rather than just specialising in one area. Sure, when you get into the later years where you can choose your subjects you can select a few that allow you to specialise, but the point is that there are always some core subjects you are forced to take, and these expose you to some things that you might not encounter had you not attended uni.</li></ul>


<p>Not everyone is lucky enough to get into Uni or college (for whatever reason), and so they put time aside to teach themselves the things that they need to know to get work in a certain field. Hats off to them :) This isn&#8217;t easy to do, and even when you do it it&#8217;s hard to find a company that will look past the lack of a degree and give you the chance that you deserve.</p>

<p>The problems with <em>just</em> self studying are:<ul><li>You <em>only</em> learn what you&#8217;re interested in. Let&#8217;s face it, when you&#8217;re doing things in your own time you focus on the things that you find interesting, and skip the boring bits. This tends to result in the person getting specialised knowledge in a certain area and not having a good coverage of other areas which would be required to get a job. I&#8217;m not saying everyone is like this as there are dedicated people out there who would force themselves to get through the boring stuff too :).</li><li>Self-learning doesn&#8217;t necessarily allow you to get involved in group assignments. Teamwork is a huge part of a developer&#8217;s day job, and experience in this area is important. Working by yourself on all your projects doesn&#8217;t present you with the people challenges you&#8217;ll face while at work.</li><li>If you&#8217;re unable to find a tutor or a mentor, you have a strong possibility of learning bad habits or practices which aren&#8217;t good.</li><li>It&#8217;s much easier to get stuck in your ways, as you don&#8217;t have the constant nagging of a lecturer telling you that a certain practice is bad, and since it&#8217;s always worked, there&#8217;s no reason to change!</li></ul></p>

<p>OK, I don&#8217;t want that to sound like I&#8217;m dissing self-learners, because I&#8217;m not. They have a drive that you don&#8217;t find in a lot of Uni students, and that&#8217;s one thing that I love about those guys. Unfortunately for self-learners, it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to find work without having a qualification. It&#8217;s becoming the &#8220;standard&#8221; to have a degree before you get a job in a lot of white-collar industries, particularly Info Tech. The only way to get round a lot of these issues for self-learners it to either get involved with an open-source project where they can work with other people to build some software, or to build something themselves. The key to this point is making sure that the project is <strong>finished</strong>. It&#8217;s very easy to start a million projects, it&#8217;s always hard to finish just one! So if you can prove to people that you can finish things you have started, then you&#8217;re already a step ahead of 99% of the contenders.</p>

<p>I do think that having a degree-qualified person who has made an effort to teach themselves other things that Uni doesn&#8217;t is the best option. From my experience, those people not only have the knowledge gained from the study, but they have the drive to see things through.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts and experiences?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can no longer resist the temptation to talk about DRM (at least in part) after the issues that I faced over the weekend. I know I&#8217;m not the only one that has experienced the pain that I&#8217;m about to describe, and I&#8217;m pretty pissed off about it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to be getting married pretty soon, and as a result my fiance and I are both trying to finalise arrangements for the wedding. One of the things that we&#8217;re trying to get right is the music that we want to have playing at various points, and over the weekend we spent a bit of time going over quite a few options. After pretty lengthy discussions (which aren&#8217;t yet over) we got together a shortlist of albums with songs that we would like to have played. In order to make our lives a lot easier, we wanted to have the songs ripped to my PC so we could play with the order of songs in playlists to get the right feel/flow.</p>

<p>This is where the pain started. <em>Most</em> of the CDs ripped perfectly fine to MP3 using <a href="http://cdexos.sourceforge.net/" title="CDex" target="_blank">CDex</a> and the LAME encoder that comes with it. There were a couple of CDs, however, that just didn&#8217;t want to behave. Out of the two CDs that didn&#8217;t want to play nice, I managed to get one of them to rip, but the second just refused to work. I think I might know how to solve the problem after doing a bit of research, but this obviously brought my thoughts on DRM to the front of my mind - which is why I&#8217;m posting.</p>

<p>So why do we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management" title="Digital Rights Management" target="_blank">DRM</a>? Why is it being rammed down our throats every time we buy a new CD? The answer is simple: the music production companies feel that they need to have some form of mechanism in place to prevent music from being ripped and shared across the world by pirates. While this is a knoble cause, it has nasty effects on those people who <em>do</em> pay for their music.</p>

<p>One of those effects is that users are unable to play the music on their MP3 player. It makes me wonder what the point is of having an iPod or Network Walkman when you can&#8217;t rip CDs to be able to put the content on them anyway? What happens if I don&#8217;t own a normal standalone CD player, but instead only have an MP3 player and my computer which I use for the transfer? In short: I&#8217;m screwed.</p>

<p>I feel that while there is a need to stop the pirating of music content, there is no way that legitimate consumers of music should suffer as a result of the extremely crap mechanisms that are currently in place. The worst of the crap mechanisms out there is one that <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2005/10/sony-rootkits-and-digital-rights.html" title="Sony, Rootkits and Digital Rights Management Gone Too Far" target="_blank">Sony has used</a>. Not only does it go out of its way to hide itself so that you don&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s installed, it even goes as far as to provide a mechanism for other programs to hide themselves. This has been exploited already by malware, and Sony have copped a bit of a hiding as a result.</p>

<p>Has this kind of thing made any difference? No not really. Companies are still putting mechanisms in place to stop people ripping their music. I&#8217;m bloody sick of it.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s be honest. If you really want to rip music, you will find a way. There&#8217;s a stack of information out there which will cover almost any scenario well enough to point you in the right direction. What does this mean to the average user? Well, those people who <em>do</em> buy their music are more likely to <strong>not</strong> know where to look to find this information out. Those people who deliberately pirate music are the kinds of people who not only know how to get round most copy-protection mechanisms, but are likely to circumvent them by themselves and let other people know how they did it.</p>

<p>The net effect is not a reduction in piracy. Instead it&#8217;s the legitimate user who cops it. The pirates have it easy, as they always seem to be up to speed or one step ahead, and Joe Blow sits in front of his PC baffled and cursing his new purchase wishing he&#8217;d never wasted the money on the CD in the first place.</p>

<p>I personally feel that in the long run DRM mechanisms like this are going to prevent people from buying. If I find a CD that I want to buy, then I&#8217;ll look for the information regarding the copy protection. If there is some in place, chances are I won&#8217;t bother buying it.</p>

<p>When are the big companies going to wake up and stop slapping their clients with DRM software that does nothing but make their lives more difficult? We need more and more artists to get behind the consumer and stop the production companies from installing DRM on their albums. We should be free to play our purchased music on whatever the hell we want - and that includes PCs and MP3 players.</p>

As the link above states:<blockquote>The new logo for its Japanese Fire Fox, Foxkeh, was apparently chosen out of a field of 600.</blockquote>How could they not see the issue with the image before releasing it to the world?</p>

<p>Not that it matters ;) I like the logo - it implies that Firefox is <em>shit hot</em>, which I think it is :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In light of the recent <a href="http://www.yarr.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Talk Like A Pirate">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>, I thought I&#8217;d have a quick rant about piracy. This is a bit of a touchy subject and I&#8217;m sure that everyone&#8217;s got their opinion, but I think that there are (or at least <em>were</em> a few years back) both good and bad sides to piracy.</p>

<p>First we should become clear on the types of piracy we&#8217;re talking about so there&#8217;s no confusion. First, there&#8217;s piracy of content such as music and movies, and second there&#8217;s piracy of software such as games, development tools and desktop applications. I&#8217;ll briefly touch on the former, and cover the latter in a bit more detail (since this is more my realm). Yes, I&#8217;m aware the software such as games can come under the <em>content</em> banner, but for the sake of this discussion I&#8217;m going to keep them separate.</p>

<p><strong><u>Content Piracy</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with a generalisation :) I do not agree with content piracy. I think that artists and content creators such as actors deserve to get covered for the efforts they have made to produce the items that we use for our personal entertainment. I can only imagine how hard it would be to produce an album or a movie, and I take my hat off to those people who do it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of music. I have a collection that&#8217;s not huge by most people&#8217;s standards, but I do love listening to a good album (as I&#8217;m sure we all do). I am not going to deny that at some points in my life I have listened to music that I didn&#8217;t pay for, but those times have long since passed.</p>

<p>I do understand that some people find it hard to justify spending a certain amount of cash on an album when they can&#8217;t be sure that they&#8217;re going to like the content. For the most part, listening to the album in full isn&#8217;t always an option before purchasing, and listeners may only be contemplating buying an album because there&#8217;s one song on there that they like.</p>

<p>There are a few solutions to the problem. The first is to buy only the songs that you like from an online store for a buck a pop. I personally don&#8217;t like this option as the quality of these files is ridiculously low (<em>cough</em> <strong>Sony&#8217;s Connect</strong> <em>cough</em>), and getting a satisfactory audial stimulation from such files is a tough task. Another option is to buy the single, but that&#8217;s not always possible either because the artists may not release a particular song as a single. The last is to bite the bullet and just fork out for the lot and hope that you end up liking more than a single song.</p>

<p>Some people may liken this to the risk you take when you go out for a meals somewhere and pay money for someone to produce culinary delights that you hope will make your senses dance. I partly agree, but I still do hesitate when looking at albums when I can&#8217;t be sure that I&#8217;m going to like at least half of the tunes. The last time I did this I was lucky. I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/XY-Coldplay/dp/B0006L16N8" title="X&amp;Y" target="_blank">ColdPlay&#8217;s X&amp;Y</a> which remains one of my favourite albums of all time.</p>

<p>So in summary, when it comes to this kind of content, I think that we should definitely pay for the work that&#8217;s been done, but I think there needs to be more options for people to sample their potential purchases before forking out the cash - especially those people who don&#8217;t have access to the Internet where they might find samples available for download.</p>

<p><strong><u>Software Piracy</u></strong></p>

<p>I think one of the best examples of a software package that just doesn&#8217;t get paid for enough is <a href="http://www.rarsoft.com/" title="WinRAR" target="_blank">WinRAR</a>. WinRAR is an awesome application that can handle almost any type of compressed file with ease. Not only does it do the job, it does it <em>well</em>. It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s easy to use, and I find that I would use it multiple times per day just to go about my daily computer life. There are a fair few applications that attempt to what WinRAR does, but I can&#8217;t think of another one (at least on the Windows platform) that does it so well. For an application of such immense use, you&#8217;d think that most people wouldn&#8217;t think twice about buying it - especially considering it&#8217;s only <em>USD $29</em> for a single license! It even gets cheaper when you buy in bulk!</p>

<p>Nope. I can tell you from personal experience that this software is used <em>heavily</em> by people all over the world and very few of those people have actually purchased a license. Some people grab pirated serial numbers off the web, or they just deal with the constant nagging screen that says &#8220;WinRAR isn&#8217;t free, please buy it if you want to continue using it&#8221;. I can&#8217;t understand how people struggle to pay such a nominal fee to legitimately use a piece of software such as this. If they can afford to use the web regularly and they can afford a PC which can access the web, then I&#8217;m sure they can scrape another few bucks together over a relatively short period of time to allow them to pay for it.</p>

<p>There are quite a few examples this, but I won&#8217;t be going through them all. So now I&#8217;d like to talk about where I think piracy might in some ways have a positive effect on the developer. To me, the best examples of this are in the areas of development and creation of other content/software in itself. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/" title="Visual Studio" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/3dsmax/" title="3D Studio Max" target="_blank">3DS Max</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="Adobe Photoshop" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> are three classics. Please bear in mind that I&#8217;m using these examples because a few years ago it wasn&#8217;t possible to get learning or &#8216;free&#8217; licences of most of these apps.</p>

<p>I started to learn to write software at a young age (whether this is a good or a bad thing remains to be seen :)). Back then I used GWBasic and QBasic as they came for free with my licensed copies of MSDOS, so I didn&#8217;t have to worry about buying the compilers. When I moved on to the C language I think I used <a href="http://www.htsoft.com/products/PACIFICc.php" title="Pacific C" target="_blank">Pacific C</a>, but I can&#8217;t be sure.</p>

<p>Through the geek circles at school I soon learned about some upcoming languages such as Visual Basic, and funky development applications like Visual Studio. Were there free versions of them available? No. As a budding software geek, all I wanted to do was learn how to use these tools, but I wasn&#8217;t able to because I just couldn&#8217;t justify the cost of the licences.</p>

<p>This brings me to the point: I think that in cases like this, piracy can be a good thing. There are no doubt thousands of people all over the world who are current <em>licensed</em> users of Visual Studio that actually learned the ropes of the application via the use of a pirated copy. What was the result of the piracy? Quite a few more users of the software who, when they could afford it, bought it to use in their professional lives, and in the process they become advocates of the software, and they put it and it&#8217;s supporting platforms out to more and more customers.</p>

<p>I believe that most of the people who have mastered 3DS Max would have learned the ways using a bootlegged copy before they had the skills which allowed them earn enough cash in the field to buy a license. Photoshop might be a slightly different kettle of fish but I think the same principle applies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think there are quite a few cases where people grab pirated copies of such software because it&#8217;s the &#8220;best product on the market in that field&#8221; and they just have to have a copy for themselves rather than using it for learning purposes.</p>

<p>Thankfully these days things are very different. There&#8217;s free versions of the Microsoft utilities (such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/" title="Visual C++ Express" target="_blank">Visual C++ Express Edition</a>), there&#8217;s a special edition of 3DS Max called <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/gmax/" title="gmax" target="_blank">gmax</a> which is a cut down version of the full 3DS Max package which allows you to create content for various game titles while allowing you to learn the basic principles of 3D modelling using a Max-like package. I&#8217;m not sure about Photoshop, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there was some form of free version which allowed people to become familiar with it.</p>

<p>So to sum up, I think that there are cases where piracy can allow people to learn software which will allow them to pay for, use and promote that software in the future. There&#8217;s less of a need these days as most software (and games) are available as a demo or time-limited preview. There are cut down editions which are available for free, and each of these options normally covers more than enough functionality for a standard user.</p>

<p>The one thing I&#8217;ve mentioned briefly already is pirating for the sake of pirating. There are stacks of people around who download Photoshop even though they don&#8217;t need it, or won&#8217;t use most of its features. There are people who grab movies and songs purely because they&#8217;ve heard from other people that they&#8217;re good, but they don&#8217;t end up listening to or watching them. This makes no sense to me at all, and I think it&#8217;s just plain wrong.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to talk about is how people just for some reason to continue pirating despite the fact that they really don&#8217;t need to due to the alternatives that are available. It&#8217;s probably because the alternatives don&#8217;t market themselves well (if at all) and noone really knows about them.</p>

<p>The question I ask to a Photoshop pirate is: Why not use <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" title="Paint.NET" target="_blank">Paint.NET</a>? The question I ask to an MS Office pirate is: Why not use <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" title="OpenOffice" target="_blank">OpenOffice</a>? The question I ask to an UltraEdit priate is: Why not use <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="VIM" target="_blank">VIM</a> (ok, maybe I&#8217;m pushing it a bit there :)).</p>

<p>You get the point. There&#8217;s so little need to pirate software these days considering there is such a massive selection of alternatives to choose from. Arguably, <a href="/posts/office-registration-and-activation/" title="Office Activation and Registration">you&#8217;re better off using the free and open source applications anyway</a>!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m not a pirate, and I don&#8217;t advocate piracy. I just wanted to explore the reasons for it, and the options the pirates don&#8217;t seem to be aware of. If you use it, watch it, or listen to it - you should pay for it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things that I think every web developer on the planet is sick of doing is building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD_%28acronym%29" title="CRUD" target="_blank">CRUD</a> methods for their applications. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that we seem to do as developers over and over again despite the fact that this task is essentially monkey work.</p>

<p>There have been quite a few attempts to nail this issue on the head in various programming camps, and it&#8217;s these attempts that I&#8217;d like to go over - partly because I&#8217;m also sick of CRUD, and partly because I don&#8217;t know enough about <em>all</em> of these solutions to know which one&#8217;s work best in what scenario (hopefully this is where you guys come to the rescue :)).</p>

<p>I have to make sure that I&#8217;m clear - I am not talking about creation of supporting object-graph loading or anything funky like recursive deletion in code (rather than as a DB setting). I&#8217;m simply talking CRUD and CRUD alone :)</p>

<p><strong><u>1. Code Generation</u></strong></p>

<p>This is quite a common solution to the problem. One of the developers either builds a tool, suggests a tool, or downloads a tool that can be used to generate a stack of CRUD methods off some form of data definition. Some of these utilities are able to read the database schema directly, some of them need XML definitions, others do neither and require some other form of manual intervention. The good utilities simple provide a basic interface to the database&#8217;s definition and allow you to wrap your own templates around them.</p>

<p>The thing I don&#8217;t get with this solution is that there&#8217;s still a hefty chunk of work to be done to get the templates for the code <em>and</em> the stored procedures ready and bug-free.</p>

<p><strong><u>2. Hibernation</u></strong></p>

<p>This is something I know very little about at the moment. From what I can see on the surface, Hibernation refers to the handling of the persistence of objects (eg. in <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html" title="NHibernate" target="_blank">.NET</a> or <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" title="Hibernate" target="_blank">Java</a>) to and from relational databases such as MS SQL Server or MySQL. It attempts to decouple the database implementation and schema from the system&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model" title="Domain Model" target="_blank">domain model</a> - which is a good practice that aids us in preventing the domain model from being polluted with details of the underlying data store. Apart from that, the framework handles the mapping of objects to the data model and vice versa - I liiiiike, it is niiiiiice.</p>

<p>This sounds very nice, but I have to reserve judgement as I&#8217;m yet to give it a spin myself. If it does what it says on the tin, then we&#8217;re all in happy joy joy land. I&#8217;ll try and get round to having a play with it in the next couple of weeks and see how easy it is to get going. If I can, I&#8217;ll try and benchmark it a bit too so we can get an idea of the performance. I&#8217;m interested to know how well this solution scales.</p>

<p>Apparently Microsoft are looking to create something similar to this (or are in the process of creating it). I believe they&#8217;re calling it &#8220;ObjectSpaces&#8221;, but don&#8217;t quote me on that :)</p>

<p><strong><u>3. Object Databases</u></strong></p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t really kept up to speed with the advances in the field of object databases, but I&#8217;ve recently been handed a link to something that looks quite interesting called <a href="http://www.db4o.com/" title="db4objects">db4o</a> which looks to be a Java and .NET implementation of an object database. The idea of an object database isn&#8217;t new, but this framework looks like it&#8217;s making good ground.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in this case, it looks like the performance isn&#8217;t too crash hot and it&#8217;s not really scaling that well. Not just that, but I&#8217;m not sure if the issues of concurrency and data reporting have been nailed either. Again, this is something I&#8217;m yet to really play with, and I&#8217;ll give it a fair go before dismissing it. At the moment my gut feeling is that it&#8217;s not yet a viable solution for anything more than a hobby project, despite the apparent ease of use. I love the way it&#8217;s so easy to persist things and retrieve them again, but until the above issues start being nailed there&#8217;s no way it can be considered for anything of a larger scale.</p>

<p><strong><u>What are the others</u></strong></p>

<p>This is a question for you guys? I&#8217;m sure there are stacks out there which are worthy of mention, and I just have no idea what they are. Feel free to send over some links to other viable solutions and let me know what you think of them.</p>

<hr/>


<p><strong>EDIT &#8211;</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d just like to add a quick follow-up to this. Christof over at <a href="http:/www.db4o.com/" title="db4objects">db4o</a> did me a favour and brought to my attention the current purpose of db4o, which is something I didn&#8217;t really know before (his comment can be read in the comments section). My focus while writing this blog post was to explore the options for the replacment of the issues faced in an &#8220;enterprise&#8221; system where there are potentially hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of records and a large amount of simultaneous transactions taking place. It looks like, at least for now, db4o isn&#8217;t intended to be used in such a scenario. Perhaps in the future this is something that will be targetted? Also, when I stated that it looked like it was handy for a hobby project, I wasn&#8217;t implying that hobbyists are the only people who would find it useful. Clearly it already has a use in embedded environments - I simply meant as a back-end DB for people building systems they may be using at home as part of a hobby project.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s stacks of information on this on their site and users forums, so I should get my butt over there and do a bit more reading :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick one this morning. I have starting gathering a list of software applications that I use all the time (or will use) which I find to be good. There&#8217;s quite a few of these lists out there already, but I thought I&#8217;d comment on the stuff that I find useful and give you guys the chance to have a play with them yourself. If you think you know of something that is worthy, let me know and I&#8217;ll check it out.</p>

<p>The list will be growing constantly as I find more time to add to it, and so it&#8217;ll remain on it&#8217;s own page which can be found <a href="/software-list/" title="Software List">over here</a> (there&#8217;s also a permanent link in the side-bar).</p>
