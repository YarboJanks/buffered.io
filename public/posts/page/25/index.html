As the link above states:<blockquote>The new logo for its Japanese Fire Fox, Foxkeh, was apparently chosen out of a field of 600.</blockquote>How could they not see the issue with the image before releasing it to the world?</p>

<p>Not that it matters ;) I like the logo - it implies that Firefox is <em>shit hot</em>, which I think it is :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In light of the recent <a href="http://www.yarr.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Talk Like A Pirate">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>, I thought I&#8217;d have a quick rant about piracy. This is a bit of a touchy subject and I&#8217;m sure that everyone&#8217;s got their opinion, but I think that there are (or at least <em>were</em> a few years back) both good and bad sides to piracy.</p>

<p>First we should become clear on the types of piracy we&#8217;re talking about so there&#8217;s no confusion. First, there&#8217;s piracy of content such as music and movies, and second there&#8217;s piracy of software such as games, development tools and desktop applications. I&#8217;ll briefly touch on the former, and cover the latter in a bit more detail (since this is more my realm). Yes, I&#8217;m aware the software such as games can come under the <em>content</em> banner, but for the sake of this discussion I&#8217;m going to keep them separate.</p>

<p><strong><u>Content Piracy</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with a generalisation :) I do not agree with content piracy. I think that artists and content creators such as actors deserve to get covered for the efforts they have made to produce the items that we use for our personal entertainment. I can only imagine how hard it would be to produce an album or a movie, and I take my hat off to those people who do it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of music. I have a collection that&#8217;s not huge by most people&#8217;s standards, but I do love listening to a good album (as I&#8217;m sure we all do). I am not going to deny that at some points in my life I have listened to music that I didn&#8217;t pay for, but those times have long since passed.</p>

<p>I do understand that some people find it hard to justify spending a certain amount of cash on an album when they can&#8217;t be sure that they&#8217;re going to like the content. For the most part, listening to the album in full isn&#8217;t always an option before purchasing, and listeners may only be contemplating buying an album because there&#8217;s one song on there that they like.</p>

<p>There are a few solutions to the problem. The first is to buy only the songs that you like from an online store for a buck a pop. I personally don&#8217;t like this option as the quality of these files is ridiculously low (<em>cough</em> <strong>Sony&#8217;s Connect</strong> <em>cough</em>), and getting a satisfactory audial stimulation from such files is a tough task. Another option is to buy the single, but that&#8217;s not always possible either because the artists may not release a particular song as a single. The last is to bite the bullet and just fork out for the lot and hope that you end up liking more than a single song.</p>

<p>Some people may liken this to the risk you take when you go out for a meals somewhere and pay money for someone to produce culinary delights that you hope will make your senses dance. I partly agree, but I still do hesitate when looking at albums when I can&#8217;t be sure that I&#8217;m going to like at least half of the tunes. The last time I did this I was lucky. I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/XY-Coldplay/dp/B0006L16N8" title="X&amp;Y" target="_blank">ColdPlay&#8217;s X&amp;Y</a> which remains one of my favourite albums of all time.</p>

<p>So in summary, when it comes to this kind of content, I think that we should definitely pay for the work that&#8217;s been done, but I think there needs to be more options for people to sample their potential purchases before forking out the cash - especially those people who don&#8217;t have access to the Internet where they might find samples available for download.</p>

<p><strong><u>Software Piracy</u></strong></p>

<p>I think one of the best examples of a software package that just doesn&#8217;t get paid for enough is <a href="http://www.rarsoft.com/" title="WinRAR" target="_blank">WinRAR</a>. WinRAR is an awesome application that can handle almost any type of compressed file with ease. Not only does it do the job, it does it <em>well</em>. It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s easy to use, and I find that I would use it multiple times per day just to go about my daily computer life. There are a fair few applications that attempt to what WinRAR does, but I can&#8217;t think of another one (at least on the Windows platform) that does it so well. For an application of such immense use, you&#8217;d think that most people wouldn&#8217;t think twice about buying it - especially considering it&#8217;s only <em>USD $29</em> for a single license! It even gets cheaper when you buy in bulk!</p>

<p>Nope. I can tell you from personal experience that this software is used <em>heavily</em> by people all over the world and very few of those people have actually purchased a license. Some people grab pirated serial numbers off the web, or they just deal with the constant nagging screen that says &#8220;WinRAR isn&#8217;t free, please buy it if you want to continue using it&#8221;. I can&#8217;t understand how people struggle to pay such a nominal fee to legitimately use a piece of software such as this. If they can afford to use the web regularly and they can afford a PC which can access the web, then I&#8217;m sure they can scrape another few bucks together over a relatively short period of time to allow them to pay for it.</p>

<p>There are quite a few examples this, but I won&#8217;t be going through them all. So now I&#8217;d like to talk about where I think piracy might in some ways have a positive effect on the developer. To me, the best examples of this are in the areas of development and creation of other content/software in itself. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/" title="Visual Studio" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>, <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/3dsmax/" title="3D Studio Max" target="_blank">3DS Max</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/" title="Adobe Photoshop" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop</a> are three classics. Please bear in mind that I&#8217;m using these examples because a few years ago it wasn&#8217;t possible to get learning or &#8216;free&#8217; licences of most of these apps.</p>

<p>I started to learn to write software at a young age (whether this is a good or a bad thing remains to be seen :)). Back then I used GWBasic and QBasic as they came for free with my licensed copies of MSDOS, so I didn&#8217;t have to worry about buying the compilers. When I moved on to the C language I think I used <a href="http://www.htsoft.com/products/PACIFICc.php" title="Pacific C" target="_blank">Pacific C</a>, but I can&#8217;t be sure.</p>

<p>Through the geek circles at school I soon learned about some upcoming languages such as Visual Basic, and funky development applications like Visual Studio. Were there free versions of them available? No. As a budding software geek, all I wanted to do was learn how to use these tools, but I wasn&#8217;t able to because I just couldn&#8217;t justify the cost of the licences.</p>

<p>This brings me to the point: I think that in cases like this, piracy can be a good thing. There are no doubt thousands of people all over the world who are current <em>licensed</em> users of Visual Studio that actually learned the ropes of the application via the use of a pirated copy. What was the result of the piracy? Quite a few more users of the software who, when they could afford it, bought it to use in their professional lives, and in the process they become advocates of the software, and they put it and it&#8217;s supporting platforms out to more and more customers.</p>

<p>I believe that most of the people who have mastered 3DS Max would have learned the ways using a bootlegged copy before they had the skills which allowed them earn enough cash in the field to buy a license. Photoshop might be a slightly different kettle of fish but I think the same principle applies.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think there are quite a few cases where people grab pirated copies of such software because it&#8217;s the &#8220;best product on the market in that field&#8221; and they just have to have a copy for themselves rather than using it for learning purposes.</p>

<p>Thankfully these days things are very different. There&#8217;s free versions of the Microsoft utilities (such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/" title="Visual C++ Express" target="_blank">Visual C++ Express Edition</a>), there&#8217;s a special edition of 3DS Max called <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/gmax/" title="gmax" target="_blank">gmax</a> which is a cut down version of the full 3DS Max package which allows you to create content for various game titles while allowing you to learn the basic principles of 3D modelling using a Max-like package. I&#8217;m not sure about Photoshop, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there was some form of free version which allowed people to become familiar with it.</p>

<p>So to sum up, I think that there are cases where piracy can allow people to learn software which will allow them to pay for, use and promote that software in the future. There&#8217;s less of a need these days as most software (and games) are available as a demo or time-limited preview. There are cut down editions which are available for free, and each of these options normally covers more than enough functionality for a standard user.</p>

<p>The one thing I&#8217;ve mentioned briefly already is pirating for the sake of pirating. There are stacks of people around who download Photoshop even though they don&#8217;t need it, or won&#8217;t use most of its features. There are people who grab movies and songs purely because they&#8217;ve heard from other people that they&#8217;re good, but they don&#8217;t end up listening to or watching them. This makes no sense to me at all, and I think it&#8217;s just plain wrong.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to talk about is how people just for some reason to continue pirating despite the fact that they really don&#8217;t need to due to the alternatives that are available. It&#8217;s probably because the alternatives don&#8217;t market themselves well (if at all) and noone really knows about them.</p>

<p>The question I ask to a Photoshop pirate is: Why not use <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" title="Paint.NET" target="_blank">Paint.NET</a>? The question I ask to an MS Office pirate is: Why not use <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" title="OpenOffice" target="_blank">OpenOffice</a>? The question I ask to an UltraEdit priate is: Why not use <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="VIM" target="_blank">VIM</a> (ok, maybe I&#8217;m pushing it a bit there :)).</p>

<p>You get the point. There&#8217;s so little need to pirate software these days considering there is such a massive selection of alternatives to choose from. Arguably, <a href="/posts/office-registration-and-activation/" title="Office Activation and Registration">you&#8217;re better off using the free and open source applications anyway</a>!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#8217;m not a pirate, and I don&#8217;t advocate piracy. I just wanted to explore the reasons for it, and the options the pirates don&#8217;t seem to be aware of. If you use it, watch it, or listen to it - you should pay for it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the things that I think every web developer on the planet is sick of doing is building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRUD_%28acronym%29" title="CRUD" target="_blank">CRUD</a> methods for their applications. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that we seem to do as developers over and over again despite the fact that this task is essentially monkey work.</p>

<p>There have been quite a few attempts to nail this issue on the head in various programming camps, and it&#8217;s these attempts that I&#8217;d like to go over - partly because I&#8217;m also sick of CRUD, and partly because I don&#8217;t know enough about <em>all</em> of these solutions to know which one&#8217;s work best in what scenario (hopefully this is where you guys come to the rescue :)).</p>

<p>I have to make sure that I&#8217;m clear - I am not talking about creation of supporting object-graph loading or anything funky like recursive deletion in code (rather than as a DB setting). I&#8217;m simply talking CRUD and CRUD alone :)</p>

<p><strong><u>1. Code Generation</u></strong></p>

<p>This is quite a common solution to the problem. One of the developers either builds a tool, suggests a tool, or downloads a tool that can be used to generate a stack of CRUD methods off some form of data definition. Some of these utilities are able to read the database schema directly, some of them need XML definitions, others do neither and require some other form of manual intervention. The good utilities simple provide a basic interface to the database&#8217;s definition and allow you to wrap your own templates around them.</p>

<p>The thing I don&#8217;t get with this solution is that there&#8217;s still a hefty chunk of work to be done to get the templates for the code <em>and</em> the stored procedures ready and bug-free.</p>

<p><strong><u>2. Hibernation</u></strong></p>

<p>This is something I know very little about at the moment. From what I can see on the surface, Hibernation refers to the handling of the persistence of objects (eg. in <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/343.html" title="NHibernate" target="_blank">.NET</a> or <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/" title="Hibernate" target="_blank">Java</a>) to and from relational databases such as MS SQL Server or MySQL. It attempts to decouple the database implementation and schema from the system&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model" title="Domain Model" target="_blank">domain model</a> - which is a good practice that aids us in preventing the domain model from being polluted with details of the underlying data store. Apart from that, the framework handles the mapping of objects to the data model and vice versa - I liiiiike, it is niiiiiice.</p>

<p>This sounds very nice, but I have to reserve judgement as I&#8217;m yet to give it a spin myself. If it does what it says on the tin, then we&#8217;re all in happy joy joy land. I&#8217;ll try and get round to having a play with it in the next couple of weeks and see how easy it is to get going. If I can, I&#8217;ll try and benchmark it a bit too so we can get an idea of the performance. I&#8217;m interested to know how well this solution scales.</p>

<p>Apparently Microsoft are looking to create something similar to this (or are in the process of creating it). I believe they&#8217;re calling it &#8220;ObjectSpaces&#8221;, but don&#8217;t quote me on that :)</p>

<p><strong><u>3. Object Databases</u></strong></p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t really kept up to speed with the advances in the field of object databases, but I&#8217;ve recently been handed a link to something that looks quite interesting called <a href="http://www.db4o.com/" title="db4objects">db4o</a> which looks to be a Java and .NET implementation of an object database. The idea of an object database isn&#8217;t new, but this framework looks like it&#8217;s making good ground.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in this case, it looks like the performance isn&#8217;t too crash hot and it&#8217;s not really scaling that well. Not just that, but I&#8217;m not sure if the issues of concurrency and data reporting have been nailed either. Again, this is something I&#8217;m yet to really play with, and I&#8217;ll give it a fair go before dismissing it. At the moment my gut feeling is that it&#8217;s not yet a viable solution for anything more than a hobby project, despite the apparent ease of use. I love the way it&#8217;s so easy to persist things and retrieve them again, but until the above issues start being nailed there&#8217;s no way it can be considered for anything of a larger scale.</p>

<p><strong><u>What are the others</u></strong></p>

<p>This is a question for you guys? I&#8217;m sure there are stacks out there which are worthy of mention, and I just have no idea what they are. Feel free to send over some links to other viable solutions and let me know what you think of them.</p>

<hr/>


<p><strong>EDIT &#8211;</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d just like to add a quick follow-up to this. Christof over at <a href="http:/www.db4o.com/" title="db4objects">db4o</a> did me a favour and brought to my attention the current purpose of db4o, which is something I didn&#8217;t really know before (his comment can be read in the comments section). My focus while writing this blog post was to explore the options for the replacment of the issues faced in an &#8220;enterprise&#8221; system where there are potentially hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of records and a large amount of simultaneous transactions taking place. It looks like, at least for now, db4o isn&#8217;t intended to be used in such a scenario. Perhaps in the future this is something that will be targetted? Also, when I stated that it looked like it was handy for a hobby project, I wasn&#8217;t implying that hobbyists are the only people who would find it useful. Clearly it already has a use in embedded environments - I simply meant as a back-end DB for people building systems they may be using at home as part of a hobby project.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s stacks of information on this on their site and users forums, so I should get my butt over there and do a bit more reading :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick one this morning. I have starting gathering a list of software applications that I use all the time (or will use) which I find to be good. There&#8217;s quite a few of these lists out there already, but I thought I&#8217;d comment on the stuff that I find useful and give you guys the chance to have a play with them yourself. If you think you know of something that is worthy, let me know and I&#8217;ll check it out.</p>

<p>The list will be growing constantly as I find more time to add to it, and so it&#8217;ll remain on it&#8217;s own page which can be found <a href="/software-list/" title="Software List">over here</a> (there&#8217;s also a permanent link in the side-bar).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been a gamer for a very long time. My interest in games is what launched my programming career, and as a young kid I used to spend hours trying to figure out how those games worked on my Commodore Vic 20. Peeking and Poking was as far as I got in those days, but the interest has been around since. For many years I worked hard to try and get a job in the games industry, and with the industry here in Australia being quite hard to get into I decided to head to the U.K. where there are more developers and a bit more opportunity to get the foot in the door. After contracting for a year to build up some funds (Australian dollars don&#8217;t do so well against the Pound) I ended up working for a game company in Guildford. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had so much fun at work, and just between you (the rest of the world) and me, there are quite a few things I miss about that job. I have talked in the past about finding people who are good, and one of the things I failed to mention (because my list was far from exhaustive) was <strong>passion</strong>. While there are people in <em>any</em> industry that lack passion for what they do, you can&#8217;t help but feel that the greatest concentration of passionate developers lies in the realms of games development.</p>

<p>That little blurb isn&#8217;t really necessary reading for the purpose of this article, I guess I just wanted to let you know that I have a bit of a background in playing, and building, games. I&#8217;m sure that many gamers out there will agree with me when I say that it&#8217;s getting to the point now where there are so few titles being released that really push the boundaries of gameplay. There are a <em>s**tload</em> of games released all the time, most of which suck (either fully or partially). To be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a game on the planet that doesn&#8217;t suck in <em>some</em> way. The thing is, in my opinion, the amount of suckiness (let&#8217;s call it <strong>suckage</strong> to keep with the gaming theme) in games is going up and up. Suckage is increasing rapidly, and I&#8217;ve been finding it hard to get excited about new gaming technology (such as the next-gen consoles) and the games that will be running on them &#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230; until today!</p>

<p>Well that&#8217;s not 100% true, I have in some ways been excited, but not to the same <em>extent</em> as the excitement I felt today. The reason is because of the shower of gold that is known as the <a href="http://wii.nintendo.com/" title="Nintendo Wii" target="_blank">Nintendo Wii</a>. I have been keeping tabs on the situation surrounding the Wii ever since Nintendo first announced that they were going to be making a next-generation games console, which back then was codenamed the <em>Revolution</em> (which, in my opinion, they should have stuck with - but I&#8217;m no marketing genius :)). There&#8217;s been quite a bit of speculation about how good or bad this console is going to be, and lately it has really been under fire - not just because of it&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>The first thing geeks do when they hear about new hardware is look at the tech specs and compare to either what&#8217;s on the market already or what the product is going to be competing with. I&#8217;m not going to list all the specifications of the Wii (or it&#8217;s competitors) but at first glance it <em>does</em> look like the Wii lacks grunt compared to the consoles it&#8217;s going to be taking on. So already the naysayers are stating that the console will choke because it just &#8220;can&#8217;t keep up&#8221;. Add on to this the new controller, which is quite out of the ordinary, and you&#8217;ve got most of the gaming population pointing, laughing and saying that the console will &#8220;&#8230; suck due its lack of power, pissy name and TV-remote-style controller.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think they&#8217;re wrong. <em>Very very</em> wrong. There&#8217;s something about this console and it&#8217;s features that I find very compelling. The new remote controller initially seems wierd when you first look at it, but when you take a bit of time to think about how it might work, you come to realise that it&#8217;s actually quite natural. I think that this style of control is going to unlock an element of fun that the other consoles, with their standard games and standard controllers, will fail to unlock. Let&#8217;s face it, games aren&#8217;t about the whizzbang graphics, or about how many rocks there are flying about on screen at once - they&#8217;re about <em>FUN</em>! Nintendo cottoned on to this notion from the very start. Not one person who has played Nintendo games from the start can say that they&#8217;ve not had fun <strong>consistently</strong> on most (if not all) Nintendo hardware. These guys have mastered the art of producing technology which allow people to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>The link that kicked this feeling to the front of my mind was one I stumbled on (and I don&#8217;t even know how) earlier today - it&#8217;s called the <a href="http://www.trustedreviews.com/article.aspx?art=3431" target="_blank" title="TrustedReviews - Nintendo Wii Preview">Nintendo Wii Preview</a>. Nine pages of Wii goodness that really need to be checked out. If you don&#8217;t know what the Wii is, then you should read this and have a look at the official homepage. It&#8217;s going to be a blast.</p>

<p>In short, I think this console will win the next-generation console wars. It captures an element of fun that the other consoles can&#8217;t capture. It adds a style of gameplay that the other consoles can&#8217;t add. It&#8217;ll make <em>old</em> games replayable purely because of the way you interact with it. It&#8217;ll get more people involved because you don&#8217;t have to be a grandmaster with a &#8220;normal&#8221; gamepad controller any more, you just need to time you natural movements properly.</p>

<p>I think there are so many possibilities for this console that it&#8217;s going to last for a <em>very</em> long time. I think there might even be a chance for me to get Amy playing some games in front of the TV with me, which would be great fun - especially when we&#8217;re throwing ourselves around the room because of the nature of the controls.</p>

<p>Come on Wii! I may have laughed at you in the early days, but I&#8217;ll take your low specs and fun games over the shiny, spaceship-style Xbox360/PS3 with great looking but poor gaming titles any day.</p>

<p>Thank you Nintendo. You&#8217;ve given an old gamer a glimmer of hope that the next generation of console gaming has the chance of being enjoyable, and not just packed with suckage!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Computer failures. We&#8217;ve all been bitten by them, and I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;ll all be bitten by them again. Good quality HDD storage is becoming more common, but despite the advances in technology, our drives still only have a <em>reliable</em> lifetime of a few years. Power supplies are becoming more solid, but they still blow up. Motherboards, while having more features than you poke a stick at, are still susceptable to being killed by something as simple as static electricity at the slightest touch.</p>

<p>The result of losing <em>any</em> part of your computer half-way through a project is pretty devastating, especially if it&#8217;s the HDD. This isn&#8217;t just because of the loss of information, but also because of the loss of time that it takes to get things up to speed again. That time includes redoing all the work that was lost <em>and</em> getting a new machine built and ready to go so that development work can recommence.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to explore the options reducing the impact of hardware failures on our geek lives. The reason I thought I&#8217;d rant was because Danny Ireland recently <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/how-to-blow-up-2-computers-in-2-weeksthe-the-ballad-of-the-spare-computer/" title="How to blow up 2 computers in 2 weeks" target="_blank">experienced an event like this</a>.</p>

<p>From this point on I&#8217;ll be using the term <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> (VM) as a meaning for having an operating system running inside a window :) So this might be using <a href="http://www.vmware.com" title="VMware" target="_blank">VMWare</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/virtualpc/" title="VirtualPC" target="_blank">Microsoft VirtualPC</a>, <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/" title="Bochs" target="_blank">Bochs</a> or something similar.</p>

<p>To start off with, I&#8217;m one of those guys who likes to have his computer running at a blistering/optimum speed even if he&#8217;s not going to be doing anything that requires it :) I know I&#8217;m not alone in this world either. As a result, the idea of doing my daily activities inside a VM isn&#8217;t that appealing. Not just that, but VMs tend to always have some form of refresh and response issues which just frustrate me.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the coin, I don&#8217;t like the idea of having to reboot every time I want to fire up a new operating system, which is one of the things that VMs nail on the head. Another things is being able to have them all running at once if you really want.</p>

<p>The argument for dual-booting vs VMs has no affect on the issues surrounding a hardware failure, I just thought I&#8217;d mention a couple issues surrounding the use of VMs.</p>

<p>The main issue that needs to be covered is the minimal recovery time. Minimal recovery time relies on backups, and backups are always in short supply regardless of how good your backup scheme is, because you simply can&#8217;t back up real-time (well, you can, but is it something that you want to do given the overheads?). Let&#8217;s look at the areas of hardware failure and the impact it can have on your work.</p>

<p><strong><u>Video Card / Monitor</u></strong></p>

<p>Easy peasy. This has little do no impact on you as neither of these items are responsbile for retaining state. If either one of these kitties dies on you, replacing them should be a doddle. Most companies would (<em>should</em>?) have spares, and getting going again should take no more than a few minutes. If you&#8217;re good enough, you should still be able to save your work before shutting your PC down to make the changes required :)</p>

<p><strong><u>Motherboard / CPU</u></strong></p>

<p>Depending on the method of demise, this may or may not affect your work. Sure, it&#8217;s going to ditch whatever work you&#8217;ve done that&#8217;s volatile (ie. stuff you haven&#8217;t saved yet) as most CPU/motherboard failures result in the computer blue-screening, freezing, or totally shutting down. The time it takes to get the motherboard replaced varies greatly. This is due to the fact that figuring out that the motherboard is the problem is what takes the time. Replacing the mobo isn&#8217;t a huge task, but it does take a bit of time. CPUs are, again, a doddle to replace, and the time to replace is minimal - as soon as you know it&#8217;s the CPU that&#8217;s gone.</p>

<p><strong><u>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</u></strong></p>

<p>PSUs die in a similar way to what most drunk drivers do. That is, they waver around and end up crashing, and there&#8217;s always a chance that they&#8217;re going to take something else with them! The surges in power can kill any or all of the other bits that are unfortunate enough to be connected to the computer at the time. There&#8217;s no rule of thumb, you&#8217;re either luck or you&#8217;re not. Just pray that it doesn&#8217;t manage to take your HDD with it when it goes, as it&#8217;s the only thing in the machine that <em>really</em> hurts when it dies. Dan&#8217;s post contains some information on his PSU woes :)</p>

<p><strong><u>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</u></strong></p>

<p>This is the real killer. Not only is it capable of bringing your system down, resulting in the loss of all your W.I.P, but it will probably end up taking a stack of other data with it that has already been persisted. This is where things should be put in place to reduce the impact of a failure.</p>

<p>One way of doing this is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks" title="RAID" target="_blank">RAID</a> to store your information on multiple drives so that if one of the breaks you still have other copies lying around. This works well, and you&#8217;d be very unlucky to lose all your disks in one go. That doesn&#8217;t mean to say that it <em>won&#8217;t</em> happen (just ask my father-in-law who&#8217;s literally had a <strong>blast</strong> during a thunderstorm resulting in the loss of not just data, but his entire PC).</p>

<p>Another way is to have all your work stored on a network drive, and have that network drive RAIDed and backed up. This at least puts the focus on the system administrator who should be responsible for a strong backup plan which will allow you to get to the data from the day before at the very least. There&#8217;s stacks of funky network storage solutions out there (check out Paul&#8217;s purchase of a <a href="http://pauleastabrook.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!46B5EF0BB06A216B!216.entry?_c11_blogpart_blogpart=blogview&_c=blogpart#permalink" title="2TB should do" target="_blank">2TB NAS</a> as an example). This will increase your network traffic a <em>lot</em> so you&#8217;d want to make sure that your network infrastructure can deal with it, especially if you deal in massive amounts of content (eg. like source-art for a computer game). If you deal with GBs of data on a daily basis you&#8217;d want to have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_Area_Network" title="Storage Area Network" target="_blank">SAN</a> or something similar to handle the load.</p>

<p><strong><u>Hardware aside - there&#8217;s more to worry about</u></strong></p>

<p>If you lose your HDD, you&#8217;re going to have to rebuild your machine whether you like it or not. To some people this is exciting :) But those people are sick, and are usually recaptured very quickly. To most people, this is a dull and mundane task that they just don&#8217;t want to undertake. In the case of recovering from a hardware failure, I fit firmly into the latter category. Rebuilding a machine is painfully slow, but there are ways to help get back up to speed quickly:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Imaging/Ghosting</strong> - When you first build your machine, get the OS installed and kill a day installing all the other bits and pieces that you need to do your work (Office, Visual Studio, Firefox, etc), you can use a utility such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(software)" title="Ghost" target="_blank">Ghost</a> to take a snapshop of your set up and store it to disk. This image can be used to quickly create replica installations on other machines with the same hardware - which is exactly what you want to do when you rebuild your machine. Of course, this comes with the proviso that you have the same hardware when you rebuild. If there&#8217;s a consistant set of hardware across the organisation, this kind of utility really is a time saver. Unfortunately it&#8217;s not so fruitful when you have a mixture of hardware set ups.</li><li><strong>Oursourcing</strong> - I&#8217;m not a huge advocate of this, but it&#8217;s still an option. By this I mean either hire another company to make sure that there&#8217;s a replacement machine ready to rock in the case where something goes horribly wrong, or get a deal going with a company like DELL to just get another machine under warranty within 24 hours.</li></ul>


<p>There are other options too.</p>

<p>The common problem across all these solutions is that you generally can&#8217;t your environment back up to exactly how it was before the total dismemberment of your machine. It&#8217;d be lovely if snapshots of machines can be taken at arbitrary points through the day (without the pain of doing it through Ghost) and restored on arbitrary hardware at the drop of a hat, resulting in, not just your environment but your <em>data</em>, being restored. Yes, this is where those VMs come to the party. You can store your VM anywhere, and run it up on any machine that can boot (and that has a VM player on it).</p>

<p>This sounds so fine and so dandy that it&#8217;s almost too good to be true - and to a point it is. You have to have some plan of managing the backups of the VM snapshots, and you need to cater for when they need to be copied. Most VM images are quite large due to the amount of software that needs to be installed (imagine how bad it&#8217;s going to be having to copy a VM of Vista, which without <em>any extra</em> software weighs in at a hefty <strong>9GB</strong>!?).</p>

<p><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>

<p>I like the idea of having my own VM that can follow me from machine to machine. I like the thought of being able to boot multiple operating systems at any time, and interact with them all at once. I also like the idea of getting the most out of my hardware with an installation that only has what it needs installed and running. The problem is that I don&#8217;t think given the current set of tools available, that you can have both of these at the same time. I&#8217;m not saying that the performance of a VM is woeful (far from it), but until I can&#8217;t notice a difference between playing a game in or out of a VM, I&#8217;ll probably end up sticking with a normal install.</p>

<p>VMs are great for test environments (reverting to a pre-test state is a two-click process), they&#8217;re great for persistance of entire operating system state for easy use on multiple machines, and they&#8217;re even free now thanks to VMware!</p>

<p>Even with all those positives, I think I&#8217;d still prefer to stick to a standard OS install for the main operating system and development environment, with VMs as test environments. I would have RAID in each of my machines with shared drives that are backed up over night so that data and more than a day old isn&#8217;t lost.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#8217;s down to the user or the copmany to choose what they think fits best for their scenario. I think in Dan&#8217;s case, he was particularly unlucky. Even if I was in his shoes, I&#8217;d stick to what I&#8217;ve just described in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>What would you guys do? Do you think your company has a strategy that gives you good coverage? I&#8217;d like to hear what procedures you guys have in place to cover for this - and I&#8217;m sure Dan would like to as well!</p>

<p>PS. For those who care, the title of this blog post <em>should</em> translate to &#8221;<em>Recovering from a dead computer</em>&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Right now I&#8217;m finding this question a tough one to answer. The hardcore geeks out there are probably saying &#8220;install all the distros you need!&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not sure if I want to do that or not. Right now, I&#8217;m thinking not, and it&#8217;s going to take a bit of time to convince me that having multiple distros installed is valuable to me.</p>

<p>I do want to have at least one Linux distribution running on my machine at home. I think over time there&#8217;s a very strong possibility that I will end up with a few, but right now, having more than one will not serve any purpose. So I have to make the decision.</p>

<p>The short-list is <a href="http://www.gentoo.org" title="Gentoo Linux" target="_blank">Gentoo</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" title="Ubuntu Linux" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>. Why? Well, I&#8217;ve played with Gentoo in the past and I really liked it, partly because it was very similar to buying a bunch of bricks and wood and attempting to build a house. It took a bit to learn and get going, and that was part of the appeal for me as learning new stuff was a key part of the undertaking. While I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve got stacks more to learn as far as Linux goes, I&#8217;m not sure if I want to go through the pain of getting it set up again, I&#8217;d rather have it just work for me without a great deal of effort (yes, you Linux geeks at the back, settle down! :)). There are a few other things I like about Gentoo, including <a href="http://gentoo-portage.com/" title="Gentoo Portage" title="_blank">portage</a> and the way things are compiled using settings that are configured to make the most of <em>your</em> hardware.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;ve heard some really nice things about Ubuntu, and I&#8217;m yet to play with this distro myself. I&#8217;ve heard it&#8217;s much easier to set up, and is a very &#8220;friendly&#8221; Linux distro - that is, one that I don&#8217;t have to fight with too much to get going and get configured to work well for me. One negative thing that I have heard about this is that the 64-bit version isn&#8217;t quite as &#8216;solid&#8217; as it is on Gentoo, but I might be wrong.</p>

<p>There is one side of me that says &#8221;<em>go with what you know</em>&#8221; and stick with Gentoo, but the true geek in me says &#8221;<em>get your hands dirty with something new and see what all the fuss is about</em>&#8221; and go with Ubuntu. Dan the Man over at <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com" title="Shiftperception" target="_blank">Shifty</a> (and at least <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/how-to-blow-up-2-computers-in-2-weeksthe-the-ballad-of-the-spare-computer/" title="How to blow up 2 computers in 2 weeks" target="_blank">one of his colleagues</a>) are using Ubuntu, and Dan himself likes it very much. I have a close mate in the USA (greetings Bryce :)) who has been a fan and an advocate of Gentoo for a long time, and his arguments are always hard to ignore (though I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be happy to hear of people using any form of Linux over Windoze).</p>

<p>So which is it going to be? I think I might just go the Ubuntu route and see how it treats me. If I feel that it&#8217;s not enough I may even put the effort into getting Gentoo running alonside it. The ultimate goal would be to have Win32, Win x64, Gentoo <em>and</em> Ubuntu all running at once. Of course this comes with the question: Should I be doing multi-boots? Or should I create Virtual Machines instead?</p>

<p>Tough call. I think I&#8217;ll answer that in my next post when I respond to <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/how-to-blow-up-2-computers-in-2-weeksthe-the-ballad-of-the-spare-computer/" title="How to blow up 2 computers in 2 weeks" target="_blank">Dan&#8217;s blog</a> :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading Dan&#8217;s response to <a href="/posts/is-an-ide-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/" title="Is an IDE all it's cracked up to be?">this</a> a few days ago, I decided to have a bit of a play with Notepad++. I do think it&#8217;s a very nice little text editor with some lovely features. It&#8217;s quitck, it&#8217;s simple, and the syntax hilighting works a treat (no thanks to Scintilla of course). One thing I do like is that by default when line numbering is on and word-wrap is enabled, gaps appear between the numbers to indicate that a line has wrapped (I need to set up something like this with VIM, as it&#8217;s one of the things that&#8217;s currently driving me nuts). It&#8217;s a shame it&#8217;s Windows only! I now have it installed at work and I used it when I work on quite a few different things including stored procedures, general markup (XML/HTML/etc), and some other bits and pieces of code.</p>

<p>A couple of nights ago I also decided to install <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/" target="_blank" title="XEmacs">XEmacs</a> to see what it was like to edit text. So many people love Emacs and there are just as many evangelists for this as their are VI/VIM. I found it to be very much like VIM, but there was one thing that stood out which I didn&#8217;t quite like. That is, the command mode seemed to be extremely heavy on the use of the CTRL and ALT keys. That may sound like a petty whinge to you, but for me, having to keep at least one of my little fingers at the bottom of the keyboard while I&#8217;m moving around becomes painful. I like VIM&#8217;s idea of not having to move any fingers away from the home row if you want to move up/down/left/right by a single line/character. Pressing CTRL every time is a bit of overkill in my opinion, and it&#8217;s a bit off-putting for me. After going through a few tutorials with I noticed that my hands were becoming strained. I&#8217;m pretty sure this is partly down to my typing style (because I&#8217;m not a perfect touch-typist, I tend to use my left little finger for SHIFT and CTRL rather than alternating depending on the key I am pressing).</p>

<p>So the result is that I&#8217;ve decided to cut short my time with Emacs and carry on doing my best to learn VIM. I can use VIM enough to be able to do my work, but I&#8217;m still frustrated because I know I&#8217;m nowhere near being the power user that I dream to be. It&#8217;s all about the practice. I do find myself getting annoyed at the fact that I have to constantly refer to the quick-ref guide to do some of the basic things, but I&#8217;m sure this will happen less and less over time.</p>

<p>I am still on the search for the ultimate development environment though. I do feel that having something which is a combination of VIM and Visual Studio would be awesome. I am even thinking of putting some time aside to build it myself. In my mind I have a vision of a unified IDE which not only has in-built support for debugging code, but has features such as memory windows, call stacks, etc - combined with the power of VIM for editing text, and the generic &#8220;Windows&#8221; functionality of things like CTRL-TAB for moving across buffers (yes, I know you can configure VIM to do this).</p>

<p>I have a question for everyone :) I&#8217;ve done only a little bit of true development on a <em>nix machine, and I&#8217;m interested to know which tools most people use when <em>they</em> develop for </em>nix. I&#8217;d even be interested to know what you&#8217;d use for <strong>Mac</strong> development?! Are there are good selection of environments to use? Or is it all Emacs/VIM with a bunch of plugins? I realise VIM comes with some form of autocomplete, which I&#8217;m yet to play with, but how well does this work? Is it smart enough to autocomplete on functions names that don&#8217;t exist in the current file scope? Do your respective text editors have any support for intellisense? What is the <em>project-wide</em> support like? Is it really a pain in the butt to get debugging working? How easy it is to have your editor build your project for you without you having to manually create build files?</p>

<p>Yup, I can get these answers of <a href="http://www.google.com.au/" title="Google" target="_blank">Google</a>, but I&#8217;m interested to hear the thoughts of the folks that find themselves reading this :D</p>

<p>As a final point, me ol&#8217; mucka Keef pointed out that games developers are in a way &#8216;forced&#8217; to use Visual Studio, and to a point I agree. But that doesn&#8217;t mean to say that you can&#8217;t use something like VIM for basic coding tasks if you really want to. I used to work with a guy who was a real Emacs junkie, and that&#8217;s all he used for his dev work (that includes Win32/C++ coding through to HTML, C# and ASP). All the compiling and debugging was done from Emacs, and he seemed to be very productive with it - something I&#8217;m nowhere near achieving with VIM :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Productivity. It&#8217;s something that all of us, as developers, should be finding ways to increase. I say <em>should</em> because I know of a stack of people out there who don&#8217;t. In fact, there&#8217;s a surprising amount of people out there who are not only <strong>not</strong> looking to find ways to increase productivity, they seem to go out of their way to reduce it - and this doesn&#8217;t just affect their own output, it affects that of the people they work with.</p>

<p>This is going to sound like a bit of a whinge, but I don&#8217;t mean it to :) I have a few frustrations when it comes to my routine that I would like to share, and see if you guys/gals feel the same, or have other things that you consider to be a hindrance while working.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Typing speed</strong > - The first thing that most of you will think when you read that first title is &#8220;learn to touch-type&#8221;. And yes you&#8217;re right! But I have already. I learned to touch-type back in the days of university when I was well and truly frustrated by the speed at which I could get my ideas down in code. Thankfully, I&#8217;m nowhere near as slow as I used to be, but I&#8217;m still nowhere near as fast as I&#8217;d like. I don&#8217;t think this is something that people should use as a measure to determine if one developer has a higher output than the other, because quality of what is created is just as, if not more important, than the amount of code produced. There&#8217;s no point in having lots of code if it&#8217;s all rubbish. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that being a two-finger typist is justified either. I&#8217;ve worked with a fair few dudes who type so slow I feel like going to sleep when I sit <em>next</em> to them. I find it quite strange that they don&#8217;t feel compelled to learn to increase their typing speed just so they can get things down quicker. But I digress, this isn&#8217;t about other people, this is about me. I think that I&#8217;m close to having my fingers move as fast as I&#8217;m able to move them. Sure, I need to increase my accuracy, and I know that I could probably get the pace up just a little more, but I doubt I&#8217;ll ever reach the break-neck speeds of the really good typists (and that&#8217;s not just because I&#8217;m writing code instead of normal text). I don&#8217;t know about the rest of you, but the QWERTY keyboard layout can be painful to type on at faster speeds, which isn&#8217;t surprising considering it was designed to slow typists down in the ol&#8217; days. I&#8217;m actually considering the possibility of learning to touch-type using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard" title="Dvorak Keyboard" target="_blank">Dvorak</a> keyboard, just to see if the layout changes do actually allow for a decent improvement in typing speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing your Tools</strong> - This relates to my <a href="/posts/is-an-ide-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/" title="Is an IDE all it's cracked up to be?" target="_blank">other post</a> regarding IDEs and text editors. Finding the tool(s) which allow you to do the job the fastest is half the battle - mastering them is the other half. Mastering VIM/EMACS can be a huge task, but the benefits are massive. Learning to utilise all the features of a rich IDE can also take quite a bit of time and practice, but the payoffs are well worth the effort. If any of you have worked with a &#8220;click-n-drag&#8221; or &#8220;drag-n-drop&#8221; coder in the past then you&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about. Knowing the tool, and the shortcuts that go with it allow you to drastically affect your output. Of course, there&#8217;s more to the &#8220;tool&#8221; category than the stuff you write code in. There&#8217;s the compiler, the build system, the software environment, the version control system, and a stack of other things. Until you nail all the things you use daily, you&#8217;re never going to work at an optimal level.</li>
<li><strong>A non-obstructive Version Control System (VCS)</strong> - I know I&#8217;m possibly opening another can of worms by saying what I&#8217;m about to say, but I&#8217;m going to say it anyway. There are a plethora of VCSs out there, most of which do a really good job. There are some that quite blatently suck to the point where they&#8217;re almost not worth having, and others that just go over the top with tweakability and bind you too strictly to a long and drawn-out process that they also become ineffective. I think the key is to find a VCS that&#8217;s going to allow you to do what you need to do on a daily basis in an efficient manner without being burdoned with an overly elaborate process which takes more time to follow than it does to do your job (<em><strong>*cough*</strong> Rational <strong>*cough*</strong></em>) In the time I&#8217;ve spent working as a professional, I&#8217;ve had the (mis)fortune of working with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/previous/ssafe/" title="Visual Source Safe (old version)" target="_blank">VSS</a>, <a href="http://www.perforce.com/" title="Perforce" target="_blank">Perforce</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/rational" title="IBM: Rational" target="_blank">Rational</a>, <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="Subversion" target="_blank">SVN</a>, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" title="CVS" target="_blank">CVS</a> and <a href="http://www.alienbrain.com/" title="AlienBrain" target="_blank">AlienBrain</a>. I&#8217;m not going to go through and give a review of each of these bits of kit as that would be worthy of a whole new blog post (perhaps I&#8217;ll do that down the track), but I will say this: SVN and Perforce are stand-out performers (with their own pros and cons). I am yet to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/products/vssafe/default.aspx" title="VSS 2005">VSS2005 with TFS</a>, but I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s a <em>drastic</em> improvement on the otherwise unstable (and old) VSS. Of course, these systems may prove to be way too complex or not good enough depending on your needs and the size of the team/project you&#8217;re working on.</li>
<li><strong>Interruptions</strong> - I&#8217;m sure I can speak for 99.9% of the development population when I say that constant interruptions are just a <em>P.I.T.A.</em> when it comes to trying to get things done. Now, depending on how lucky, or unlucky, you are, you may find yourself in a position where you tend to be a fairly regular point of contact for a <em>lot</em> of people. It could be that you&#8217;re a knowledgable developer with a certain language, you may have a strong understanding of the software and its architecture, you may be Team Lead or Lead Programmer and hence are a point of contact for the managers/clients/end-users, you may just be a nice person that people like to talk to! At the end of the day, the interruptions can hinder the creative process and have a detrimental effect on your output. Yes, I find this frustrating despite the fact that I know it&#8217;s part of the job :) That doesn&#8217;t mean to say I get angry with people if they want to talk to me, it&#8217;s more that when I&#8217;m getting into my work I like to get it done.</li>
<li><strong>Meetings</strong> - These drive me nuts, purely because I&#8217;d be lucky to attend 1 in 10 meetings which actually feel like a good use of time. If there&#8217;s one sure fire way of killing of a good couple of hours where you could be working, it&#8217;s to hold a meeting. I&#8217;d like to say thanks in advance to anyone who may respond and tell me that it&#8217;s well within my power to change the way these meetings go, but I think we all know that in a real world scenario (particularly when you&#8217;re working on-site) there&#8217;s a pretty good chance of you not being able to control it. I have, on more than one occasion, got up and left a meeting half-way through because I have felt that it&#8217;s just been a huge waste of time. It&#8217;s easy to get away with a stunt like this when you&#8217;re a permanent employee, or perhaps a Team Lead where your time is perceived to be quite valuable. Unfortunately, we&#8217;re not always in a position where taking this option is feasible. The best we can do is try and push the meeting in a direction where there&#8217;s a remote chance of getting some value before the hours tick by.</li>
<li><strong>Rubiks Cubes</strong> - I find these addictive! If I have one at my desk, then I feel compelled to play with it in the hope that the practice will aid in my target of consistently finishing it under the 60-second mark. Anyone who&#8217;s worked with me will probably know exactly where I&#8217;m coming from :) Yes, it&#8217;s a bad habit, and I&#8217;m doing all I can to rectify it. For now, it&#8217;s best for me to remove any evidence of cubes before I start my day :D</li>
<li><strong>Other people</strong> - This point does fit in with the point above that talks about interruptions, but I think this is worth mentioning on it&#8217;s own. The above point talks about being interrupted by people because you have a role or a set of knowledge that requires people to constantly talk to you. <em>This</em> point covers those people who constantly interrupt you for no apparent reason. They may feel they have a good enough reason, eg. to talk about how tanked they got the night before, or how so-and-so did something stupid at the Christmas party - but let&#8217;s face it, after hearing that story 5 or 6 times, the tiny amount of novelty you might have got out of it the first time has worn off. Then there&#8217;s the guy who, despite his every effort, &#8220;just doesn&#8217;t get it&#8221;. So you end up having to explain something to him not once, not twice, and not three times &#8230; but <em>n</em> times (where <em>3 &lt; n &lt; &infin;</em>). Call me impatient, and say that I&#8217;m a bastard who should do all I can to help the guy, that&#8217;s fine - but there comes a time when whoever it is should be able to understand it.</li>
</ul>


<p>So there you have it. Some of the things that I find frustrating about working from day-to-day. The list is far from exhaustive, in fact there&#8217;s one that I&#8217;ve missed intentionally because it&#8217;s going to be the subject of another post:</p>

<p><strong>The use of all the latest and greatest buzzwords without first determining if it&#8217;s useful to the project.</strong></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Boy that was quick! I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s still some DNS servers out there that need to be updated, but things certainly moved quickly. Blackapache is now on a new server, and I&#8217;m pretty darned happy with the ease and speed of the move. Not just that, but this new location feels a heck of a lot faster than the old one.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;re back online! Feel free to continue commenting/posting. I&#8217;ll be back later (possibly even later today) with some thoughts on episodic gaming.</p>
