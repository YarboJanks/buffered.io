  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, I&#8217;ve started dabbling in the joys of Linux by installing Ubuntu (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/support/faq#head-3df1e0e29bc1a807664ce156fb9fe6f09c35bfdd" title="Ubuntu FAQ" target="_blank">Dapper Drake</a>). This was partly joyous and partly painful - but mostly joyous :) While going through some of the less enjoyable moments I spent a fair bit of time trawling forums and hanging in IRC channels (#ubuntu-au on irc.freenode.net to be exact, check out <a href="http://ubuntu.com.au/welcome/" title="Ubuntu Australian Team" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.matthewv.id.au/ubuntu-au/" title="Ubuntu Australian Team" target="_blank">here</a>) trying to find the information I needed to get things going.</p>

<p>The most recent issue that I have since solved is that of getting drivers working with my ATi Radeon X1900-XTX, and it was the pain of this set up that inspired me to write this post - and in fact, what will look to be a long stream of posts. After the quality of feedback and help, and the time investment by some of the guys in #ubuntu-au (thanks lads! Especially <em>DarkMageZ</em> and <em>siccness</em>), I thought that I want to help share this information to aid in getting other people up to speed to. In fact, I&#8217;ve decided to start a whole new category of blog posts - HOWTOs! You can consider this the first :) I won&#8217;t just be doing HOWTOs on things that I experience with Linux, but I&#8217;ll aim to cover code examples, bits and pieces to do with Windows, and whatever else takes my fancy. Information should be shared, so feel free to let me know if anything that you would like me to share, and I&#8217;ll do my best to cover it.</p>

<p>So, on with the juicy bits. The default installation of Ubunutu worked fine with the vesa driver which allowed Xorg to fire up without any issues, but of course, I wasn&#8217;t happy to suffer for second best while having a fairly beefy video card. The goal was to get the ATi drivers working in both 2D and 3D.</p>

<p>The first mistake that I made was to approach the issue in the same way that I would approach it as a Windows user - that is, go to the ATi driver website and download the latest driver. This turned out to be a bit of a mistake, but I&#8217;ll go through the process I took anyway just FYI :) I downloaded the driver from the <a href="http://www.ati.com/online/customercareportal/linux.html" title="Linux ATi Drivers" target="_blank">ATi Linux driver page</a> and read the instructions that came with it. Seemed fairly simple, so I did as I was told and waited for the magic to happen.</p>

<p>The first thing that I failed to notice was that the install notes stated that the driver had only been tested with Red Hat Linux. Now I don&#8217;t know if there is that much of a difference between that and Ubuntu, but given that certain things refused to work I&#8217;m <em>guessing</em> they are. After performing the installation, I restarted Xorg (which, FYI, can be done using the shortcut <strong>CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE</strong>) and I was knocked off my chair by the clarity of what I was seeing. It was magic :) But to my dismay, things were not all good under the hood. It turned out that even though 2D was clearly working, the 3D part (and with it OpenGL functionality) was nowhere to be seen. This is what got me started with the forum trawling and the IRC rants. I learned very quickly that downloading the driver from the ATi site was a bad move, and that I should have instead used the <strong>apt-get</strong> functionality to get the drivers set up.</p>

<p>At this point I went through the process of uninstalling the drivers that I had downloaded, and got my machine back to a point where I could try and install the new ones. The <em>vesa</em> driver fuzzyness returned and I was ready to rock with the instructions I was given. I downloaded and installed the correct drivers using the correct utility and did exactly what I was told to do, only to find that this refused to work as well. The driver install was apparently successful, but I still had the VESA fuzzyness indicating that the driver was not loading properly. I read around some more, and chatted some more, and determined that I needed to modify my <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong> file to set the default video driver to <strong>fglrx</strong> (not VESA), so that&#8217;s what I did!</p>

<p>Restarting Xorg resulted in my world crumbling (well, not quite ;)). My screen was blank. I had no UI, I had no idea what was on screen, so I ended up having to boot back in using recovery mode and modifying the file so that it was set back to VESA. It was about this time I was getting pretty narked as I&#8217;d been messing with quite a few things for a few hours and my patience was wearing thin.  It was 11:45pm when I thanked my Aussie Ubuntu colleagues for their help and made the move to shut down, as I was going to continue tackling the problem the next day. While shutting down, I was just having a last flick through the tabs I had open in FireFox when I noticed a comment at the bottom of a forum thread. This turned out to be the magic missile!</p>

<p>There are a stack of modules that you can specify to load in Xorg, and apparently there&#8217;s issues with the ATi driver when two of the many are loaded at the same time. The suggestion was to comment out the culprit (which was called <strong>extmod</strong> I believe) which was clashing with the one you needed (which was called <strong>dri</strong>, I think :)). After making this change, I restarted Xorg and all was clear and beautiful! And for the first time ever on this new installation both <strong>fglrxinfo</strong> and <strong>glxgears</strong> behaved the way they should. 2D and 3D was up and running! Mission accomplished.  So, now that my story is told, please find listed below the steps that I had to take to get the ATi drivers installed on Ubuntu AMD64 Dapper Drake. I hope you find them useful.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx-control
sudo aticonfig --initial

take a backup copy of /etc/X11/xorg.conf
edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf using your favourite text editor:
- change the Driver option from "vesa" to "fglrx"
- comment out the line that says : Load "extmod"

restart xorg (CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE)
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck all! Hopefully next up will be my success story with my wireless network card.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You gotta hand it to this guy, he says that he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t like closed systems&#8221;, which is pretty darned obvious :) The man, Jon Lech Johansen, who years ago cracked the DVD encryption known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scrambling_System" title="Content Scrambling System" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and released (with two other unknowns) the software that could be used to decrypt DVDs (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS" title="DeCSS" target="_blank">DeCSS</a>), has taken his code-breaking career to a new level - he&#8217;s nailed Apple iPod&#8217;s <a href="http://www.andrewhargadon.com/blog/?p=36" title="iPod's Ecosystem" target="_blank">ecosystem</a> (or so he claims) by breaking their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay" title="FairPlay" target="_blank">FairPlay DRM software</a>.</p>

<p>I have no reason to find his claims outrageous, since he&#8217;s quite clearly experienced in this area (he was 15 when he cracked CSS after all), so it looks like Apple have got themselves an issue to deal with. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if they take steps to stop him and his new <a href="http://doubletwistventures.com/" title="DoubleTwist" target="_blank">DoubleTwist</a> venture from taking off, or releasing any information/software pertaining to the crack.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ubunutu.com" title="Ubuntu" target="_blank"><img src="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebsiteButtons?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ubuntu_button_120x60_ooh.png" width="120" height="60" alt="Ubuntu Linux" class="InlineImageLeft" /></a>While mulling over the meaning of life during the course of the day, I decided to take the plunge and install <a href="http://www.ubunutu.com" title="Ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> on the disk that I freed up ages ago - why I waited this long, I really don&#8217;t know, I think it might have something to do with lack of spare time (or laziness). I thought that you all might like to know the bits that were good and the bits that were bad :)</p>

<p>On the whole, I have to say that my experience was <em>very</em> good. I&#8217;ve used quite a few distros in the past (as I&#8217;ve mentioned in a previous post), and I have to say that absolutley <strong>none</strong> of those distros were as easy to set up as this one. <a href="http://www.redhat.com/" title="Red Hat" target="_blank">Red Hat</a> is probably the closest I&#8217;ve experienced to this, but it still doesn&#8217;t really come close.</p>

<p>I started by playing with the Live CD to see if I liked the look and feel of it, and for the most part it seemed to pick up all the hardware without any issues. It even ran the desktop at 1600x1200 by default despite not having the graphics drivers properly set up. Sure it wasn&#8217;t nice to look at, but it worked! The wired network interfaces were set up automagically, and everything was jolly swimming. After fiddling for a while, I took the plunge and went for the full install.</p>

<p>Again, this went really smoothly. After a 15 or so minute installation it was all up and running, the obvious difference along the way being that I had to set up some partitions and stuff, but for a seasoned computer builder that&#8217;s nothing special. That step has been made pretty easy for those who aren&#8217;t sure what it means by the wizard that is running through the install. So even the average Joe could have got it going.  When done, I was greeting with a lovely fresh installation with network connectivity, and everything was dandy. Not only was the install fast, it was very smooth - and it was all 64-bit.</p>

<p>So, I took a bit of time to see what gaps were left in the system, during which time the OS told me that I had a few updates to download - which I proceeded to install, again without an issue. But by this time I had realsed the gaps. First of all I needed to install the <a href="http://www.ati.com/" title="ATI" target="_blank">ATI</a> <a href="http://www.ati.com/online/customercareportal/linux.html" title="ATI Linux Driver" target="_blank">driver</a> for my <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/radeonx1900/index.html" title="Radeon X1900 Series" target="_blank">x1900-xtx</a>, which is not really a surprise as this has to be done almost regardless of the OS when you first install otherwise you&#8217;d end up with no decent graphical performance whatsoever :) I took on the task with a bit of fear in the belly, but to my surprise is installed fine! Now I&#8217;m pretty sure there are some dependencies that haven&#8217;t come through, and I think that if I tried to do anything requiring 3D acceleration then it might all come crashing down, but the desktop and all things 2D look spiffing!</p>

<p>The other gap was the wireless card - but since I had HUGE issues getting this running on my WinXP x64 I was prepared to take the hit. This is actually still an issue for me, and for some reason every time I try and do something with the wireless network interface the system becomes extremely unstable. As of yet I&#8217;m not sure what it is I&#8217;m going to do. I might update to the development version and see if they&#8217;ve fixed the issue. Downloading and rebuilding the drive from source didn&#8217;t seem to help much either, the issue remained <em>sigh</em>.</p>

<p>Other than those two, I can hardly fault the process. I&#8217;ve been chatting to some lads in the Ubuntu IRC channel on freenode, and even though we didnt manage to nail the problem the guys were more than happy to help. I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ve actually got an operating system installed that not only comes with Firefox installed by default, but doesn&#8217;t actually feel like I&#8217;m committing some form of licencing sin before I even get going! I am a big fan of constant consoles, and I do like the apt-get mechanism that Ubuntu uses (which I believe comes from the <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="Debian" taret="_blank">Debian distro</a>. The whole thing feels smooth, and though Gnome isn&#8217;t really my desktop of choice, it&#8217;s definitely not unpleasant.</p>

<p>So, on the whole I can&#8217;t really complain about the experience I&#8217;ve had. My installation was great, and I did learn new stuff along the way. When I&#8217;ve got my wireless card installed and running I&#8217;ll be able to lose the network cords and all will be back to normal. How exciting! I&#8217;d recommend this distro to many a Linux newbie, and I think they&#8217;d find the experience just as painless/painful as getting a Windows install running the first time. In fact, I reckon that it&#8217;s not only easier, it&#8217;s faster!</p>

<p>Now, time to start work on those cross-platform applications I&#8217;ve been thinking about ;)</p>

I&#8217;ve had my own thoughts on the differences between what makes a person a developer and what makes a person a programmer for some time, but I think <a href="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=90" title="Developers are from Mars, Programmers are from Venus" target="_blank">this article at Hacknot</a> bears a striking resemblance - which means I don&#8217;t have to write it out myself :)</p>

<p>A great read, and it&#8217;s something that not only hilights the differences between a lot of people you&#8217;ll find out there working in the industry, but it&#8217;ll give an idea of what I believe should be expected of you while you&#8217;re trying to do your job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just thought I&#8217;d add this last post as a bit of food for thought before signing off today. This link comes from a bloke who&#8217;s been through the pain of wanting to move away from Windows, only to find that the results were just as, if not more, painful than sticking to what he knew. Have a read of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~bederson/user-advocate/2006/09/switchback-horrors-of-windows-power.html" title="HCI User Advocate: Switchback: Horrors of a Windows Power-user Trying to Switch to Apple OS X" target="_blank">this blog entry</a> to see that the grass isn&#8217;t necessarily greener.</p>

<p>It definitely makes you wonder if the effort is going to be worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have quite a bit to cover in the gaming world today, and I didn&#8217;t want to create a separate post for each thing so I thought I&#8217;d group them all together.</p>

<p>So to start off with, there&#8217;s been some buzz around town that some &#8220;demo&#8221; PS3s have made a bit of an appearance. The guys at <a href="http://www.ign.com/" title="IGN" target="_blank">IGN</a> have been given a bit of a <a href="http://ps3.ign.com/articles/738/738858p1.html" title="IGN: PlayStation 3 Hands-on" target="_blank">hands-on session with the PS3</a>! It&#8217;s hard to call <em>bullshit</em> when there&#8217;s photos of dudes playing the console, so I&#8217;ll hold myself back for now ;) The article is quite interesting, and in my (humble) opinion doesn&#8217;t really give the PS3 a resounding thumbs up.</p>

<p>Firstly, the &#8220;demo&#8221; didn&#8217;t really clear up many of the questions the guys had:<blockquote>Interface-wise, we&#8217;ve still got a lot of unanswered questions. For example, what happens when you stick a DVD, PS1 or PS2 disc in the machine? Well, as of right now nothing - the debug unit Sony&#8217;s demoed to us still features slightly outdated firmware, meaning the machine flatly refuses to play anything other than Blu-Ray discs. Similarly, all attempts to connect our PSPs and Cyber-shot digi-cams to the console were met with resounding indifference. However, we&#8217;ll be getting our hands on an updated version of the machine imminently, so rest assured we&#8217;ll be probing even deeper next time around.</blockquote>Rest assured? Hrm, yeah right. Don&#8217;t think that the &#8220;next time round&#8221; will result in a great deal more information if it&#8217;s any time soon. Since they didn&#8217;t really have a great deal to cover given that the system was a demo system, they focussed a bit on the controller:<blockquote>Instead of duplicating that, we&#8217;ll take a look at one last thing - possibly the most controversial aspect of the PS3: the controller. Prepare to be shocked though: we don&#8217;t really like it all that much. True enough, you can go along with Phil Harrison&#8217;s proclamation that it&#8217;s already the industry-standard controller amongst umpteen-million gamers around the globe, but, arguably, that doesn&#8217;t make it the best. Personally, we can&#8217;t help but feel that the SIXAXIS (as it&#8217;s now known) has been sadly neglected when viewed alongside the rest of the PS3. Compared to Microsoft&#8217;s uber-comfortable Xbox 360 pad, the SIXAXIS feels cheap, plasticky, uncomfortable and disconcertingly light - almost as if it&#8217;s going to fly out of your hands during those more extreme gaming moments.</blockquote>So they&#8217;ve well and truly borked it! Nice work considering that the big selling point for the Wii was the controller - right now, if I were Sony I&#8217;d be nailing my controller designer to the fence. There&#8217;s a stack more to it than what I&#8217;ve quoted, and I&#8217;m not going to quote any more in case they pissed off with me reproducing parts of the article, so get over there and have a read.</p>

<p>Basically, this confirmd my thoughts on the PS3 - it&#8217;s JAGC (just another games console). Nothing that they&#8217;ve done is really going to blow my skirt up. The games will be the same games with the same style of play on a bigger, shinier and noiser box. Sure the GFX and number of bananas on screen might have increased, but it&#8217;s the same shit different look. I know I won&#8217;t be investing my cash in one for a very long time, if at all.</p>

<p>Now for something totally different - a review of a <a href="http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news?id=23483&p=1" title="The UK's First Long Wii Play Session - Report - Entertainment News, Reviews, Competitions - Entertainmentwise" target="_blank">hefty Wii gaming session</a>, which is a total switcheroo compared to the S3. The feeling I get from this review is that which I already felt for the Wii - <strong>fun fun fun!</strong> One question that many people are keen to know the answer to is whether or not the Wii controller is going to force you to break a sweat and collapse due to the amount of activity. Those lazy bastards out there will be glad to know, it looks like you don&#8217;t have to be fit and active to wield the Wii controller for extended periods of time:<blockquote>To test this, in terms of fitness we took along two regular gamers with average to low fitness and one gamer with ME/CFS.  He was able to play for the two hour slot with only a fractional tiredness issue and was if anything, making the largest motions with the remote controller out of all three of us and owned at Wii tennis!  If you have health related concerns that you or your friends and family suffer from a tiredness health problem, its not going to bar you from enjoying the Nintendo Wii.  Weve tested it now and after two hours, its safe to say that its possible to play on the Wii launch line up for two hours and not be dripping with sweat afterwards.  Just remember that large body motions are not a requirement  theyre what players do to have fun with the game.  Playing with smaller movements or sitting down is largely possible, doable and healthy.</blockquote>Interesting! That should get the whole family going :) I&#8217;ll resist temptation to regurgitate the entire article, so I&#8217;ll just finish off with: <strong>Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!</strong></p>

<p>The next point I&#8217;d like to cover is that of distribution in the games industry. For quite some time, the big companies such as EA have managed to, shall we say, &#8220;acquire&#8221; shelf-space on a fairly regular basis with the large stores like Walmart and EB Games. Needless to say this has made the issue of distribution a huge mountain to climb for those companies who are trying to get a foothold in the market. I&#8217;ll do my best not to imply that there&#8217;s a shifty deal going on between the big producers and distributors (;)) and instead focus on the solution to the problem. The best way to describe it is to give the best known example to date: <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steam Powered" target="_blank">Valve&#8217;s Steam</a>. What a fabulous idea! Online distributin of games and their content was always going to be the next step, and with Steam it&#8217;s really easy. It&#8217;s already been used to great success for games such as Half-Life 2, The Ship and Psyconauts, and it looks like the bigger fish are starting to flock to the feeding frenzy with titles such as Call of Duty and Dark Messiah. As time goes by, more and more games shops will end up with bare shelves because the cost of physical distribution through boxes and CDs just won&#8217;t be worth the effort.  I take my hat off to Valve for this step - not just because they&#8217;ve done a great job with the solution (which did have a few teething problems), but because they&#8217;re sharing the wealth with the other devs. Sure they&#8217;re going to get a piece of every game sold through Steam, but they&#8217;re not trying to use their muscle to drown out the other players in the industry which I think is a great thing.</p>

<p>If the above information doesn&#8217;t get you excited, then surely the thought of seeing <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35094" title="Unreal Engine 3 on Steam and Sonic gets physics" target="_blank">Unreal Engine 3 on Steam</a> should surely raise the eyebrows. A bit more evidence of its success can be found <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34148" title="Three coups up for Valve" target="_blank">over here</a>.</p>

<p>I also think Microsoft with their <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/livearcade/default.htm" title="Live Arcade" target="_blank">Xbox Live Arcade</a> system are going to do very well. Opening up <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/XNA/default.aspx" title="XNA" target="_blank>XNA</a> to the masses (via <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/gse/" title="Game Studio Express" target="_blank">Game Studio Express</a>) and allowing people to create their own games for sale on the Arcade mechanism opens up the floor to innovation - something that the larger game development companies no longer strive for.</p>

<p>Right, let&#8217;s wrap up with a few more nuggets of jolly goodness. That fun-filled pair <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_%26_Max_Hit_the_Road" title="Sam and Max Hit the Road" target="_blank">Sam &amp; Max</a> are making a return in <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35170" title="Sam &amp; Max ride again" target="_blank">Sam &amp; Max ride again</a>. The original game was just awesome, let&#8217;s hope that the developers of this title can back it up (at least a little) :) It looks like there&#8217;s going to be a world-wide release on the 1st of Nov 2006 - keep ya eyes peeled! It should be great.</p>

<p>Last but not least, those lovable folks at EA have decided to douse their clients with spyware that comes bundled with <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35169" title="Battlefield 2142 comes with spyware" target="_blank">Battlefield 2142</a>. How nice! Just make sure you&#8217;re not doing <em>anything</em> at all while you have this game installed and you <em>should</em> be fine. Better still, boycott the game until they remove the spyware - the whole idea of spyware in games is just wrong I think.</p>

<p>So that concludes my little games round-up. If you&#8217;re looking for something else that might be a bit more fun to read after this collection of goodies, perhaps something like <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/columns/hardcore/shadowcast/" title="GameDev.net -- Shadow Caster Volumes For The Culling Of Potential Shadow Casters" target="_blank">this</a> will take your fancy :)</p>
