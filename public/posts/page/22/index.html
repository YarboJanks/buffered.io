  <div class="entry-content"><p>Technology is pretty amazing. What makes it more amazing is that just when you think a particular idea has been taken to the <em>n</em>th degree and couldn&#8217;t go much further, another boffin comes along and shows that there is more that can be done!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35267" title="Glass CD developed" target="_blank">This glass CD</a> is a prime example. CD/DVD technology is now run of the mill. HD DVD and Blu-Ray are currently battling it out for supremecy. Where do you think the secondary storage technology will end up?</p>

<p>Even though this tech is tres cool, I personally feel that it&#8217;s getting to the point where removable media is already big enough for day to day needs. As a home user, a 4.7 GB disc is definitely big enough to do personal back-ups of data. Heck, if anything, it&#8217;s a back-up deterrant because you&#8217;re constantly waiting for more data to stick on the disc before burning it!</p>

<p>As a corporate user, tape back-ups are really the only way to go. Other than games and movies, right now I can&#8217;t see a huge need for anything bigger than a dual-layer DVD. When you end up with a disc being able to hold so much data you then have the added issue of being able to read that data off that disc <em>fast enough to make it usable</em>. It&#8217;s all well and good having huge amounts of data on these monsterous discs, but when it takes an ice-age to get access to it, all of a sudden the tech doesn&#8217;t seem so great.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to see some more advances in disc read speeds (both optical and magnetic areas), then at least the increase in volume on the media can be utilised to its full.  The hard drive and the CD/DVD drive are the slowest bits in my machine - and I can&#8217;t wait for them to catch up with the other bits!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned, I&#8217;ve started dabbling in the joys of Linux by installing Ubuntu (<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/support/faq#head-3df1e0e29bc1a807664ce156fb9fe6f09c35bfdd" title="Ubuntu FAQ" target="_blank">Dapper Drake</a>). This was partly joyous and partly painful - but mostly joyous :) While going through some of the less enjoyable moments I spent a fair bit of time trawling forums and hanging in IRC channels (#ubuntu-au on irc.freenode.net to be exact, check out <a href="http://ubuntu.com.au/welcome/" title="Ubuntu Australian Team" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.matthewv.id.au/ubuntu-au/" title="Ubuntu Australian Team" target="_blank">here</a>) trying to find the information I needed to get things going.</p>

<p>The most recent issue that I have since solved is that of getting drivers working with my ATi Radeon X1900-XTX, and it was the pain of this set up that inspired me to write this post - and in fact, what will look to be a long stream of posts. After the quality of feedback and help, and the time investment by some of the guys in #ubuntu-au (thanks lads! Especially <em>DarkMageZ</em> and <em>siccness</em>), I thought that I want to help share this information to aid in getting other people up to speed to. In fact, I&#8217;ve decided to start a whole new category of blog posts - HOWTOs! You can consider this the first :) I won&#8217;t just be doing HOWTOs on things that I experience with Linux, but I&#8217;ll aim to cover code examples, bits and pieces to do with Windows, and whatever else takes my fancy. Information should be shared, so feel free to let me know if anything that you would like me to share, and I&#8217;ll do my best to cover it.</p>

<p>So, on with the juicy bits. The default installation of Ubunutu worked fine with the vesa driver which allowed Xorg to fire up without any issues, but of course, I wasn&#8217;t happy to suffer for second best while having a fairly beefy video card. The goal was to get the ATi drivers working in both 2D and 3D.</p>

<p>The first mistake that I made was to approach the issue in the same way that I would approach it as a Windows user - that is, go to the ATi driver website and download the latest driver. This turned out to be a bit of a mistake, but I&#8217;ll go through the process I took anyway just FYI :) I downloaded the driver from the <a href="http://www.ati.com/online/customercareportal/linux.html" title="Linux ATi Drivers" target="_blank">ATi Linux driver page</a> and read the instructions that came with it. Seemed fairly simple, so I did as I was told and waited for the magic to happen.</p>

<p>The first thing that I failed to notice was that the install notes stated that the driver had only been tested with Red Hat Linux. Now I don&#8217;t know if there is that much of a difference between that and Ubuntu, but given that certain things refused to work I&#8217;m <em>guessing</em> they are. After performing the installation, I restarted Xorg (which, FYI, can be done using the shortcut <strong>CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE</strong>) and I was knocked off my chair by the clarity of what I was seeing. It was magic :) But to my dismay, things were not all good under the hood. It turned out that even though 2D was clearly working, the 3D part (and with it OpenGL functionality) was nowhere to be seen. This is what got me started with the forum trawling and the IRC rants. I learned very quickly that downloading the driver from the ATi site was a bad move, and that I should have instead used the <strong>apt-get</strong> functionality to get the drivers set up.</p>

<p>At this point I went through the process of uninstalling the drivers that I had downloaded, and got my machine back to a point where I could try and install the new ones. The <em>vesa</em> driver fuzzyness returned and I was ready to rock with the instructions I was given. I downloaded and installed the correct drivers using the correct utility and did exactly what I was told to do, only to find that this refused to work as well. The driver install was apparently successful, but I still had the VESA fuzzyness indicating that the driver was not loading properly. I read around some more, and chatted some more, and determined that I needed to modify my <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong> file to set the default video driver to <strong>fglrx</strong> (not VESA), so that&#8217;s what I did!</p>

<p>Restarting Xorg resulted in my world crumbling (well, not quite ;)). My screen was blank. I had no UI, I had no idea what was on screen, so I ended up having to boot back in using recovery mode and modifying the file so that it was set back to VESA. It was about this time I was getting pretty narked as I&#8217;d been messing with quite a few things for a few hours and my patience was wearing thin.  It was 11:45pm when I thanked my Aussie Ubuntu colleagues for their help and made the move to shut down, as I was going to continue tackling the problem the next day. While shutting down, I was just having a last flick through the tabs I had open in FireFox when I noticed a comment at the bottom of a forum thread. This turned out to be the magic missile!</p>

<p>There are a stack of modules that you can specify to load in Xorg, and apparently there&#8217;s issues with the ATi driver when two of the many are loaded at the same time. The suggestion was to comment out the culprit (which was called <strong>extmod</strong> I believe) which was clashing with the one you needed (which was called <strong>dri</strong>, I think :)). After making this change, I restarted Xorg and all was clear and beautiful! And for the first time ever on this new installation both <strong>fglrxinfo</strong> and <strong>glxgears</strong> behaved the way they should. 2D and 3D was up and running! Mission accomplished.  So, now that my story is told, please find listed below the steps that I had to take to get the ATi drivers installed on Ubuntu AMD64 Dapper Drake. I hope you find them useful.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx-control
sudo aticonfig --initial

take a backup copy of /etc/X11/xorg.conf
edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf using your favourite text editor:
- change the Driver option from "vesa" to "fglrx"
- comment out the line that says : Load "extmod"

restart xorg (CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE)
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck all! Hopefully next up will be my success story with my wireless network card.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You gotta hand it to this guy, he says that he &#8220;doesn&#8217;t like closed systems&#8221;, which is pretty darned obvious :) The man, Jon Lech Johansen, who years ago cracked the DVD encryption known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scrambling_System" title="Content Scrambling System" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and released (with two other unknowns) the software that could be used to decrypt DVDs (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS" title="DeCSS" target="_blank">DeCSS</a>), has taken his code-breaking career to a new level - he&#8217;s nailed Apple iPod&#8217;s <a href="http://www.andrewhargadon.com/blog/?p=36" title="iPod's Ecosystem" target="_blank">ecosystem</a> (or so he claims) by breaking their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay" title="FairPlay" target="_blank">FairPlay DRM software</a>.</p>

<p>I have no reason to find his claims outrageous, since he&#8217;s quite clearly experienced in this area (he was 15 when he cracked CSS after all), so it looks like Apple have got themselves an issue to deal with. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if they take steps to stop him and his new <a href="http://doubletwistventures.com/" title="DoubleTwist" target="_blank">DoubleTwist</a> venture from taking off, or releasing any information/software pertaining to the crack.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ubunutu.com" title="Ubuntu" target="_blank"><img src="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WebsiteButtons?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=ubuntu_button_120x60_ooh.png" width="120" height="60" alt="Ubuntu Linux" class="InlineImageLeft" /></a>While mulling over the meaning of life during the course of the day, I decided to take the plunge and install <a href="http://www.ubunutu.com" title="Ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> on the disk that I freed up ages ago - why I waited this long, I really don&#8217;t know, I think it might have something to do with lack of spare time (or laziness). I thought that you all might like to know the bits that were good and the bits that were bad :)</p>

<p>On the whole, I have to say that my experience was <em>very</em> good. I&#8217;ve used quite a few distros in the past (as I&#8217;ve mentioned in a previous post), and I have to say that absolutley <strong>none</strong> of those distros were as easy to set up as this one. <a href="http://www.redhat.com/" title="Red Hat" target="_blank">Red Hat</a> is probably the closest I&#8217;ve experienced to this, but it still doesn&#8217;t really come close.</p>

<p>I started by playing with the Live CD to see if I liked the look and feel of it, and for the most part it seemed to pick up all the hardware without any issues. It even ran the desktop at 1600x1200 by default despite not having the graphics drivers properly set up. Sure it wasn&#8217;t nice to look at, but it worked! The wired network interfaces were set up automagically, and everything was jolly swimming. After fiddling for a while, I took the plunge and went for the full install.</p>

<p>Again, this went really smoothly. After a 15 or so minute installation it was all up and running, the obvious difference along the way being that I had to set up some partitions and stuff, but for a seasoned computer builder that&#8217;s nothing special. That step has been made pretty easy for those who aren&#8217;t sure what it means by the wizard that is running through the install. So even the average Joe could have got it going.  When done, I was greeting with a lovely fresh installation with network connectivity, and everything was dandy. Not only was the install fast, it was very smooth - and it was all 64-bit.</p>

<p>So, I took a bit of time to see what gaps were left in the system, during which time the OS told me that I had a few updates to download - which I proceeded to install, again without an issue. But by this time I had realsed the gaps. First of all I needed to install the <a href="http://www.ati.com/" title="ATI" target="_blank">ATI</a> <a href="http://www.ati.com/online/customercareportal/linux.html" title="ATI Linux Driver" target="_blank">driver</a> for my <a href="http://www.ati.com/products/radeonx1900/index.html" title="Radeon X1900 Series" target="_blank">x1900-xtx</a>, which is not really a surprise as this has to be done almost regardless of the OS when you first install otherwise you&#8217;d end up with no decent graphical performance whatsoever :) I took on the task with a bit of fear in the belly, but to my surprise is installed fine! Now I&#8217;m pretty sure there are some dependencies that haven&#8217;t come through, and I think that if I tried to do anything requiring 3D acceleration then it might all come crashing down, but the desktop and all things 2D look spiffing!</p>

<p>The other gap was the wireless card - but since I had HUGE issues getting this running on my WinXP x64 I was prepared to take the hit. This is actually still an issue for me, and for some reason every time I try and do something with the wireless network interface the system becomes extremely unstable. As of yet I&#8217;m not sure what it is I&#8217;m going to do. I might update to the development version and see if they&#8217;ve fixed the issue. Downloading and rebuilding the drive from source didn&#8217;t seem to help much either, the issue remained <em>sigh</em>.</p>

<p>Other than those two, I can hardly fault the process. I&#8217;ve been chatting to some lads in the Ubuntu IRC channel on freenode, and even though we didnt manage to nail the problem the guys were more than happy to help. I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ve actually got an operating system installed that not only comes with Firefox installed by default, but doesn&#8217;t actually feel like I&#8217;m committing some form of licencing sin before I even get going! I am a big fan of constant consoles, and I do like the apt-get mechanism that Ubuntu uses (which I believe comes from the <a href="http://www.debian.org/" title="Debian" taret="_blank">Debian distro</a>. The whole thing feels smooth, and though Gnome isn&#8217;t really my desktop of choice, it&#8217;s definitely not unpleasant.</p>

<p>So, on the whole I can&#8217;t really complain about the experience I&#8217;ve had. My installation was great, and I did learn new stuff along the way. When I&#8217;ve got my wireless card installed and running I&#8217;ll be able to lose the network cords and all will be back to normal. How exciting! I&#8217;d recommend this distro to many a Linux newbie, and I think they&#8217;d find the experience just as painless/painful as getting a Windows install running the first time. In fact, I reckon that it&#8217;s not only easier, it&#8217;s faster!</p>

<p>Now, time to start work on those cross-platform applications I&#8217;ve been thinking about ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Which one are you? I&#8217;ve had my own thoughts on the differences between what makes a person a developer and what makes a person a programmer for some time, but I think <a href="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=90" title="Developers are from Mars, Programmers are from Venus" target="_blank">this article at Hacknot</a> bears a striking resemblance - which means I don&#8217;t have to write it out myself :)</p>

<p>A great read, and it&#8217;s something that not only hilights the differences between a lot of people you&#8217;ll find out there working in the industry, but it&#8217;ll give an idea of what I believe should be expected of you while you&#8217;re trying to do your job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just thought I&#8217;d add this last post as a bit of food for thought before signing off today. This link comes from a bloke who&#8217;s been through the pain of wanting to move away from Windows, only to find that the results were just as, if not more, painful than sticking to what he knew. Have a read of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~bederson/user-advocate/2006/09/switchback-horrors-of-windows-power.html" title="HCI User Advocate: Switchback: Horrors of a Windows Power-user Trying to Switch to Apple OS X" target="_blank">this blog entry</a> to see that the grass isn&#8217;t necessarily greener.</p>

<p>It definitely makes you wonder if the effort is going to be worth it.</p>
