  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/uploads/2010/06/Home.png" alt="Erlang Logo" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/>The time has come for another meeting of the Functional Programming minds! This months <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/calendar/12636552/" title="June BFPG Meetup">BFPG Meetup</a>, starting 6pm Monday 28th, is the first one at our new venue: Microsoft HQ, Waterfront Place, Brisbane. For details on the location, take a look at the <a href="http://bfpg.org/about/" title="About BFPG">BFPG about page</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2010/06/ruby.png" alt="Erlang Logo" style="float:left; margin-right:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/>This month we have three speakers, and I am one of them! In my talk, &#8220;Erlang - Why should you care?&#8221;, I will be giving a fairly non-technical introduction to <a href="http://erlang.org/" title="Erlang">Erlang</a>. I&#8217;ll be covering off the features of the language, some of its design goals and its history. I aiming to show that this language is not one that was spawned out of academia and that it has been applied in the real-world ever since its conception. If I have time, I&#8217;ll also be giving a small demonstration of one of the neatest features of the technology.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2010/06/haskell-logo-variation.png" alt="Erlang Logo" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/>
I&#8217;ll be posting the slides and demonstration code here on this blog as well as <a href="http://bfpg.org/" title="BFPG">BFPG&#8217;s home</a> after the meetup has taken place.</p>

<p>Myself and my comrades, <a href="http://adams.id.au/blog/" title="Nosewheelie">Tom</a> and <a href="http://blog.tmorris.net/" title="Tony's blog">Tony</a>, will aim to provide a fun and interesting evening at our new venue. Based on the RSVPs so far, it looks like we are going to have one of the biggest turn-outs to date. This is probably due to the exposure we got during last month&#8217;s <a href="/posts/dave-thomas-at-yow-nights-brisbane/" title="Dave Thomas at YOW! Nights Brisbane">talk by Dave Thomas</a>. There are still plenty of spots left, so if you&#8217;re keen to come along, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/calendar/12636552/" title="Sign up for BFPG June 10">go and sign up</a>. Bring your friends, your friend&#8217;s friends and your mum.</p>

<p>I hope to see you there!</p>

<hr/>


<p><strong>Update (6th July 2010):</strong> We had a fantastic turn-out of just short of 50 people (a record breaker for the group so far!). My talk seemed to be fairly well-received. No rotten tomatoes were thrown and the crowd seemed engaged through most of the talk. It felt good! I think many people wanted to see more code, but since that wasn&#8217;t the focus of the talk they were a little disappointed. If people are keen for more Erlang goodness at future meetups, then I&#8217;ll be happy to dive a little deeper.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a video of my talk:</p>

Nights Brisbane - May 20th">YOW! Nights</a> conference held at the local Microsoft Office here in Brisbane. The speaker for the session was none other than <a href="http://www.davethomas.net/" title="Dave Thomas">Dave Thomas</a>, the man behind the likes of <a href="http://objectmentor.com/" title="Object Mentor">ObjectMentor</a>. Not only is this guy incredibly switched on, he is thought-provoking and very entertaining to boot. I&#8217;ve been to a few of these sessions in the past but I&#8217;ve never seen one as packed out as this one. It was great to see such a turn-out, which no doubt was boosted by the presence of both the <a href="http://www.qmsdnug.org/" title="QMSDNUG">Queensland MSDN Users Group</a> and the <a href="http://bfpg.org/" title="BFPG">Brisbane Functional Programming Group</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>What is Perception?</h2>

<p>As cheesy as it sounds, I&#8217;m going to start off with a definition ripped straight off <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/perception" title="Perception | Define Perception at Dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote><h3>perception</h3>

<p><strong><em>noun</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>the act or faculty of apprehending by means of the senses or of the mind; cognition; understanding.</li>
<li>immediate or intuitive recognition or appreciation, as of moral, psychological, or aesthetic qualities; insight; intuition; discernment: <em>an artist of rare perception</em>.</li>
<li>the result or product of perceiving, as distinguished from the act of perceiving; percept.</li>
<li><em>Psychology</em>. a single unified awareness derived from sensory processes while a stimulus is present.</li>
<li>Law. the taking into possession of rents, crops, profits, etc.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/uploads/2010/03/escher.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="A classic Escher"><img src="/uploads/2010/03/escher.jpg" alt="A classic Escher" title="A classic Escher" width="250" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" /></a>Take a moment to digest the meaning of the word. Can you see how subjective it is? One&#8217;s perception varies greatly depending on the observer. The motivation of the observation is also going to skew how one is perceived. The relationship one has with the observer is also going to impact how that observer perceives you.</p>

<p>Finally, it&#8217;s important to note that what was <em>perceived</em> and any point in time is not necessarily the same as what <strong>actually occurred</strong>.</p>

The people who said it might not have used those exact words, but the intent is the same. Usually I hear it in the following form:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re very happy with the work you&#8217;ve done for us as a contractor. We want to keep you on, but would like you to take a job as a permanent employee and continue to work on the project.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Once they&#8217;ve made this point, they then feel the need to harp on about the good points of becoming a permanent employee. Things such as job security, sick/annual leave and better hours tend to get mentioned. All of them are complete bullshit of course.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no such thing as job security</strong>. Sick and/or annual leave isn&#8217;t enough to make up for the difference in pay. Hours tend to always be worse when you&#8217;re working for the man, because you&#8217;re expected to do whatever needs to be done regardless of the hours. This is worse if you&#8217;re working on mission-critical stuff.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not too long ago I mentioned that I&#8217;d <a href="/posts/now-running-nginx/" title="Now Running Nginx">setup and installed Nginx</a> on this server. All seemed well to start off with, then on certain occasions I started to notice that some pages were being served truncated while I was at work. I thought that the issue was work-related, as they have a fairly draconian security policy in place and I thought that it had something to do with severing the connection.</p>

<p>This assumption was proved false a few days ago when I received an email about my <a href="/posts/setting-up-trac-mercurial-and-ssh-on-windows/">Trac/Mercurial/SSH</a> post not rendering properly in someone else&#8217;s browser. Dammit!</p>

<p>So this time I actually did a bit of research by delving into the log files (yes, I know.. genius isn&#8217;t it!) and determined that there was indeed a problem. Thankfully it was fairly simple to resolve. For some reason the <em>fastcgi</em> instances were failing to function periodically when attempting to access a folder on disk. In short, some of the temp folders were owned by the right user, and some of them weren&#8217;t. After modifying the ownership of the appropriate folders, everything seems to be running nicely.</p>

<p>Yet more proof that <a href="/posts/the-admin-is-an-idiot/" title="The Admin is an Idiot">the admin is an idiot</a>.</p>

<p>If after I post this you notice any truncation at all across the site, please let me know! Cheers!</p>

This is despite the fact that it has happened to me so many times that you think I&#8217;d be used to it! I&#8217;m talking about non-technical people making technical decisions.</p>

<p>For some reason, it&#8217;s a very common practice for those people who don&#8217;t have expertise in a certain field to make decisions for people working in that field. The best example I can think of off the top of my head is the answer to the question: <em>&#8220;Which technology should we use?&#8221;</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/uploads/2009/10/erlang.png" alt="erlang" title="erlang" style="float:left;margin-right:5px;margin-bottom:5px;" />For quite a while I&#8217;ve been using my spare cycles to chew over a problem. This problem is not one that hasn&#8217;t been solved before, but one that I feel can be solved in a much better way. From the bit of research that I&#8217;ve done, I can see at least three areas which can be improved on dramatically. So I&#8217;ve decided, after a long period of deliberation, to go ahead and build my solution and release it to the world as a service!</p>

<p>I know, this kind of thing happens thousands of times a day. Some arbitrary geek decided to build the next killer app and expects to make a crapload of cash out of it. While that would be nice, the ultimate goal isn&#8217;t the cash. The goal for me is to build something that gets used, and for me to begin to master an area of technology that I&#8217;ve had a quiet passion for for a long period of time now.</p>

<p>My plan is simple. While learning the technologies that I will be using I&#8217;ll be building another application and blogging about it so that all of you can learn with me. Meanwhile, I shall use my learnings to build this other application at the same time.</p>

<p>The final result should be a series of posts which help other people learn the technology stack, give better coverage and visibility to languages and technologies that a lot of the geek world doesn&#8217;t know about (and really should!), and for me to carve myself a bit of a niche here on the East coast of Ozland. I am hoping to be able to consult my services out to other businesses as a result.</p>

<p>For those that are interested in following along, here is the full tech stack and toolset that I&#8217;ll be using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://erlang.org/" title="Erlang">Erlang</a> - A fantastic cross-platform functional programming language that has some amazing features.</li>
<li><a href="http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/" title="Webmachine HTTP toolkit">Webmachine</a> - A HTTP toolkit which sits on top of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/" title="Mochiweb">Mochiweb</a> that makes it easy to build well-behaved HTTP applications.</li>
<li><a href="http://nitrogenproject.com/" title="Nitrogen Framework">Nitrogen</a> - An Erlang-based framework that makes it easy to build websites.</li>
<li><a href="http://riak.basho.com/" title="Riak">Riak</a> or <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" title="CouchDB">CouchDB</a> - Both of these amazing pieces of tech are potential candidates for the back-end storage. I&#8217;m not yet sure which one I&#8217;ll go with.</li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/" title="jQuery">jQuery</a> - A great JavaScript library for the front-end.</li>
<li><a href="http://vim.org/" title="VIM text editor">VIM</a> - My favourite text editor :)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.xubuntu.org/" title="Xubuntu">Xubuntu</a> - Ubuntu <a href="http://ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu 9.10">Karmic Koala</a> with <a href="http://www.xfce.org/" title="XFCE">XFCE</a> as the window manager.</li>
<li><a href="http://mercurial-scm.org/" title="Mercurial SCM">Mercurial</a> - My favourite version control system.</li>
<li><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/" title="The Trac Project">Trac</a> - A project tracking tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" title="VirtualBox">VirtualBox</a> - My choice for virtualisation. I tend to run Windows 7 as my primary OS, so most of my dev will be in a VM. When I get my desktop machine back up and running (with all three monitors!) it&#8217;ll most likely multiboot Win 7 and Xubuntu.
<li><a href="http://wave.google.com/" title="Google Wave">Google Wave</a> - I&#8217;ll be using this for communications with some really switched on people in the Erlang community who have kindly offered to help me with questions and whatnot specific to some of the areas of tech I&#8217;ve mentioned above.</li>
</ul>


<p>During the course of my blogging/learning I&#8217;ll be focussing on Webmachine, Riak/CouchDB, Erlang and Nitrogen. All the other tools will probably get mentioned along the way, but the primary goal is to focus on these things.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really excited! I&#8217;m currently in the process of documenting my goals and the design for the main application. Once that&#8217;s done, I&#8217;ll get started with the fun stuff. I&#8217;ve got a lot to do and it should be a fun ride. I hope you enjoy following along!</p>

After feeling the resource burden of <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" title="Apache Httpd">Apache</a>, Litespeed was a breath of fresh air! The fact that the &#8220;full&#8221; version wasn&#8217;t free didn&#8217;t bother me, I was happy to stick with the standard edition as it seemed more than capable of handling the meagre traffic that this site generates.</p>
