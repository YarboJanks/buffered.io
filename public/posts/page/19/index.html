  <div class="entry-content"><p>Time for another little poll :) This new skin that I&#8217;ve got going has a funky feature which not only randomises the picture at the top of the page, but allows you to have a selection of random pictures that get rotated after a period of time. At the moment, it&#8217;s set to 3 images which rotate after 15 seconds of being visible and take 4 seconds to change between images.</p>

<p>Is this too much? Does it work? Should I keep the transition effect, or shall I just keep it as a single random image each time a page is loaded?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&#8217;ve added some more pictures now. Only three are loaded for each page to keep bandwidth down, so if you&#8217;re really keen you can refresh ;)</p>

<p>All of the pictures I&#8217;m uploading are of places in Australia :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to try and keep this post short, otherwise I&#8217;ll be here all day ranting away ;) This particular topic is one that&#8217;s fairly close to my heart because it&#8217;s a bit of a pet hate for me.</p>

<p>As we (the geeks) know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-Oriented Programming" target="_blank">object-oriented (OO)</a> programming is a different concept to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional Programming" target="_blank">functional</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming" title="Procedural Programming" target="_blank">procedural</a> programming. OO was a bit of a move forward in the direction of easy to understand, more managable and reusable code, and has been adopted all over the shop.</p>

<p>One of the first widely adopted OO languages was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="C++" target="_blank">C++</a> probably because of it&#8217;s close relationship and similar syntax to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" title="C" target="_blank">C</a>. Unfortunately, this resulted in something that continues to be a huge bane for true OO programmers all over the planet: <strong>the OOPP (object-oriented procedural programmer)</strong>.</p>

<p>OK, so that&#8217;s a term that I like to use when talking to this kind of programmer :) But the idea behind them is this: when they made the switch to C++ from C, they didn&#8217;t adopt a true OO approach to software development - all they really did was switch compilers.  There are so many people still to this day writing software using OO languages without actually writing good/proper OO code. The benefits of OO are lost on these kinds of people, and the resulting code is just a nightmare.</p>

<p>Before my current job, I worked in a couple of places where there were a few stagnant coders writing C++ - but in fact it was just C being compiled with a C++ compiler. Coupling was through the roof. Encapsulation was non-existant. Even funky features such as polymorphism were avoided to be replaced instead by huge &#8216;switch&#8217; statements which did similar things based on the &#8216;type&#8217; of a structure. Absolutely awful.</p>

<p>At the end of last year I worked with a lady who was by far the worst culprit for this. She was an advocate for &#8220;copy and paste coding&#8221;, structureless code and job security. She was appalling. How she&#8217;s managed to gain contracts for the last 13 years as a developer I will never know. It&#8217;s people like her that end up producing systems that are so unmaintainable, badly written and poorly executed that lots of people lose faith in software. She even managed to this in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp" title="C-Sharp" target="_blank">C#</a>!</p>

<p>When are people going to learn that writing procedural code doesn&#8217;t make them an OO programmer? Using an OO language isn&#8217;t enough, you need to write code in an OO manner.</p>

<p>Before I make my final point I want to make it clear that I have nothing against C, or procedural programming. They both have their place. What I feel doesn&#8217;t have a place is a programmer who refuses to write OO code when that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re hired for.</p>

<p>So, to finish up, what I want to say is this: just because you&#8217;ve written procedural code in the past and it&#8217;s always worked for you, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you can continue to do it in an OO language when you&#8217;re paid to write proper OO software. If you can&#8217;t keep up with technology, proper methodology, and best practice, then perhaps it&#8217;s time to retire?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve had the joy of dealing with many recruitment agents as I&#8217;ve been looking for a new contract.  I won&#8217;t get into the choice of job at this stage, as that&#8217;s a whole new blog post right there.  What I wanted to show was my frustration at quality of most of the job advertisements I see on the Internet.</p>

<p>To sum up:<ul><li>They generally have a lot of spelling and grammatical errors.</li><li>They highlight the lack of technical knowledge that the recruitment agent actually has.</li><li>They contain a badly formatted list of &#8220;skills&#8221;, which generally aren&#8217;t skills at all.</li><li>They almost always have no indication of the salary/rate.</li></ul>On top of this, you also get the posts that:<ul><li>List the details of a permanent job in an attempt to get contractors to apply for them.</li><li>List the details of a job in a completely different location to the one that you want in the hope that when you apply they can convince you to relocate.</li></ul>IMHO, this kind of behaviour is taking the piss. It&#8217;s no wonder that recruitment agents have such a bad reputation.</p>

<p>As a final note, I recommend having a read of <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrwizard/web/job.html" title="v" target="_blank">this</a> marvellous article - those of you who have dealt with recruiters will no doubt enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was getting sick of the way the site was looking, so I changed it. I know I&#8217;ll end up changing it again because I&#8217;ll no doubt get sick of looking at the site layout as well, but for now I&#8217;m quite happy with it. It&#8217;s a hacked version of a theme that I thought was nice, but I felt it needed some modifications. I&#8217;m not 100% finished yet, as I think the top of the page just looks bare. I&#8217;d like to stick an image in there, but my experiments so far have sucked so I think I&#8217;ll take time out to think of how I can make it work.</p>

<p>So, a new coat of paint has been applied.  Next, I need to finish some of the 50+ draft posts I have started and get some more discussions happening. I have quite an interesting one coming up about software users, so watch this space.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think of the look (if you can be arsed!).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The picture at the top of the page is another one of my home town - Brisbane :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you no doubt have guessed, I can be a little verbose from time to time as I&#8217;m ranting away ;) So I pondered the possibility of breaking up my posts across multiple pages.  I installed a plugin that allows me to break the single post up into a series of pages, and I was on the verge of using it for the first time a couple of posts ago when I thought it might not be a good idea.</p>

<p>The issue I have with it is that it <em>might</em> be a deterrant to people who are reading. So I came up with a list of pros and cons during the course of investigating the options.</p>

<p>Pros:<ul><li>Reduces bandwidth usage - By breaking the posts up into smaller pages the amount of information I&#8217;m serving up is considerably less in the cases where people don&#8217;t want to read the whole lot, or where they&#8217;ve already read the whole lot. This is not just good for the user who might be limited by downloads or speed, but good for me as it reduces the amount of information I serve up.</li><li>Reduces fright - Seeing a small amount of text makes it a lot less daunting to read than being faced with one <strong>huge</strong> page of text.</li><li>It looks cool :).</li></ul>
Cons:<ul><li>Readers aren&#8217;t immediately aware of how much they&#8217;re going to have to read.</li><li>Can be daunting if there&#8217;s a large number of pages.</li></ul></p>

<p>That&#8217;s really all I could come up with :) I&#8217;m leaning towards using them from now on when my posts get big, but I&#8217;m still not 100% sure. What do you guys think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had a few questions from people asking me why there&#8217;s a stack of <em>queer</em> looking icons appearing at the bottom of the blog posts, so I thought I&#8217;d post the details so that everyone knows.</p>

<p>The icons appear because of a plugin I recently installed called <a href="http://www.calevans.com/view.php/page/notable" title="Notable Wordpress Plugin" target="_blank">Notable</a>.  Notable is a plugin that generates links that allow for easy addition of links to various social bookmarking and networking sites.  Here&#8217;s a bit of a snippet from the web page:<blockquote>Notable displays a series of icons below each post allowing your readers to easily submit you to many different social bookmarking and networking sites.</p>

<p>This allows your users to easily submit your blog posts to these sites and increases your blog&#8217;s visibility.</blockquote>So it&#8217;s there to help you add my blog links to a stack of different pages should you feel the need to. Like what I said and want to bookmark it on a site like <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a>? Click that link and away it goes.  The icons that are listed are for a variety of possibly bookmarking and networking sites, and are there to try and accommodate whatever site you happen to like to use.</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t into that kind of thing, then just ignore them :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First of all, Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Now that the formalities are out of the way, I&#8217;ll get stuck into the post :)</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s comments are inspired a by a recent experience I had with an online form (of all things!). Being a bit of a game geek, both in the &#8216;build&#8217; and &#8216;play&#8217; senses, I constantly read a lot of gaming stuff.  One thing that I&#8217;m a fairly regular reader of is <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/" title="GamaSutra" target="_blank">GamaSutra</a>, as it&#8217;s got lots of juicy game development stuff in it - a great read for people such as myself.  I finished reading a column on <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070110/ledour_01.shtml" title="Localizing Brands and Licenses" target="_blank">Localizing Brands and Licenses</a> (sorry for the en-US spelling ;)), which was surprisingly interesting (albeit a little bit long) when I noticed a link at the top of the page saying &#8220;Game Developer Magazine&#8221;.  At this point I thought it&#8217;d be interesting to see how much it would cost to subscribe so I followed the link (and my nose) through the maze of the web to find myself at the subscription form.</p>

<p>This is where the fun started.</p>

<p>While filling out the form with the required details (name, skin colour, sexual preference, etc) I hit the inevitable &#8220;address&#8221; section.  The first thing that I thought was strange was that it was asking for my address.  I was signing up to a digitally distributed magazine, and hence the only address they should have required was an email address.  Despite this bit of common sense, I though perhaps they&#8217;d need it to verify credit card details, so I went ahead and punched it all in. When I hit the submit button, I was confused. An error came back asking me to specify a &#8220;state&#8221; for both billing <em>and</em> shipping addresses. This was particularly interesting since there was absolutely no mention of a shipping address on the form, let alone an area in which to enter it.  I assumed this was a minor bug in the system, and that if the billing address was fine then the shipping address would simple reflect that of the billing address.  So I went back to the billing address section of the form to look for the problem.  Being the intuitive fellow that I am, I assumed that since the error mentioned the &#8220;state&#8221; needed to be specified, I went straight to the &#8220;state&#8221; field to see what I had entered (in case there was an accidental blunder).  The option that I had chosen had been reset to the default, which I assume was done when the page refreshed with the error, so I had to choose an option again.  I think a picture of the options is probably the best way of showing you what I was facing, so have a look at this:</p>

<p><img id="image168" src="/uploads/2007/01/state.PNG" alt="The State Drop-Down" class="InlineImageBlock" /></p>

<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s yet another example of ignorance by a United States web page.  This is going to sound a little like a Yankee Bash, and I&#8217;m sorry for that, but I am sick to death of so many American web sites like this refused to acknowledge that the rest of the world (other than Canada) exists. You get to choose an American/Canadian state, or &#8220;Not Available&#8221;, and that&#8217;s it. So, since I live in Australia, I had no choice but to choose &#8220;Not Available&#8221;.  I hit submit again and got the same error.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, it&#8217;s too bad if you want a digital subscription to the magazine if you live outside the USA because the payment form just refuses to let you enter your details.  Rather than let myself get too narked, I thought I&#8217;d get in touch with them and let them know that their form was broken.  I took the time to fire up the support page, and send them a stack of information on the scenario.  I told them the steps, the order of events, and the information that I had specified, and the resulting error.  The comment wasn&#8217;t rude, and if anything gave too much information on how to reproduce the problem.  After hitting &#8216;send&#8217; I though that I&#8217;d hear back within 24 hours and the problem would hopefully be rectified.</p>

<p><em>Four</em> working days later I got a response, and it was not what I expected.  I have actually deleted the email so I can&#8217;t paste the content, but I do remember the gist of it, which kinda goes like this:<blockquote>Mr Reeves,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Company X with regards to your problem.  You can subscribe to the magazine by sending a cheque to [insert long USA address here] along with your details.</p>

<p>Regards,
The Company X Team</blockquote></p>

<p>WTF?! No mention of the problem, no mention of a solution, no comments at all about being sorry that the issue even existed. Instead, all I got was a &#8220;send via snail mail&#8221;.  I thought this was unbelievable - yet not surprising.  I probably don&#8217;t need to tell you that I didn&#8217;t bother with their suggestion.</p>

<p>The thing that really baffles me about this is the loss of business.  As a business, you don&#8217;t want to turn clients away.  Providing them with a workaround isn&#8217;t the same as fixing the problem - this is just bad quality of service.  Not only have they lost me as a possible client, but the problem hasn&#8217;t been fixed, which means other people who live outside the USA/Canada are going to have the same issues signing up.</p>

<p>My frustration with the rampant stupidity in the human race increases all the time :) I&#8217;ll finish by quoting something I read in <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/01/oops.html" title="Oops" target="_blank">Scott Adam&#8217;s blog</a> today:<blockquote>&#8230; its getting harder every day to be an optimist.</blockquote></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&#8217;t help but feel that over time the world is getting harder to live in. To be a bit more precise, it&#8217;s becoming very difficult to do anything at all for fear of putting yourself in the firing line, or on the receiving end of a law suit.  Two things that have caught my attention over the last couple of weeks which have really annoyed me. One of them is down to the frustration I feel when people are trying to get something for nothing, and the other is down to annoyance at regulations that are put in place which are just totally ridiculous</p>

<p>The first thing was the news that there&#8217;s a <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/19/1731210" title="Slashdot | Wiimote Straps Result in Class Action Suit" target="_blank">class action lawsuit against Nintendo</a> due to the apparently insufficient quality of the straps that hold the Wiimote on the wrist. After I first read this I decided to do a bit of research into the cases where people had lost their grip, snapped the band and witnessed the Wiimote flying through the end and breaking either something expensive, or someone&#8217;s face (or both!). In <em>every</em> case, the person&#8217;s actions have been incredibly excessive. Sure, the Wiimote no doubt gets you going. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the moment and let excitement get the better of you. But to swing that controller that hard while expecting it to stay in your hand makes you (the user) a complete tool. Instead of just easing up a little bit and admitting that they&#8217;ve gone over the top, the users are now saying that it&#8217;s Nintendos fault, and in the classic American tradition, they&#8217;re suing.</p>

<p>The second thing that&#8217;s got to me is the new Aussie rule that states that you&#8217;re no longer allowed to <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=36473" title="Illegal to Link" target="_blank">link to copyrighted material</a>. I&#8217;m not sure how broad that rule actually is, but it does sound like you could end up with someone suing you for linking to their blog post, their home-made video, or whatever it is that they&#8217;ve put online - even if you&#8217;ve helped increase the traffic to the site. I&#8217;d have sent you a link to the original SMH article, but I wasn&#8217;t sure if that was legal. Let&#8217;s be honest, if the rule is that broad and you can&#8217;t even point people at a newspaper article, the world is going nuts. The original idea of hypertext linking is now being threatened - as you&#8217;re no longer allowed to use them! Sure, link to pages in your own site, link to Google, and tell them what to search for. That should be ok. But direct linking looks to be a no-no.</p>

<p>Total and utter crap. The world is going nuts! If we keep going at this rate it&#8217;s going to become illegal to do anything other than read emails - and considering the amount of SPAM that&#8217;s buzzing around the Internet the value of that doesn&#8217;t look too good. We&#8217;re going to have to nip this shit in the bud before it goes too far. Not only will it stop the open communication and information sharing mechanism that the world is, but the threat of being sued will prevent people from innovating - that&#8217;s not the kind of world I want to live in.</p>
