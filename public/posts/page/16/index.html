  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been renting for over 10 years now, and in my time I&#8217;ve experienced quite a few different types of neighbours. Some of them were really friendly - they&#8217;d invite themselves in for a cup of tea, hang about for a while to have a yarn before heading back to their own place. Some wouldn&#8217;t speak a word and would make an obvious effort to stay away from me (arguably a wise choice :) ). I have no problems with either of these types because they have consideration for their neighbours, and tend to keep noise levels down to a bearable level.  When you share a wall with someone, you have to expect some level of noise!</p>

<p>Recently, that is about 5 weeks ago, we &#8216;acquired&#8217; a new set of neighbours who are opposite to those described above. Here&#8217;s a shortlist of the things we&#8217;ve experienced since they&#8217;ve moved in:<ul><li>Constant smell of smoke (from cigarettes and dope) billowing over the fence all over the clothes line and into the windows of the house. This happens at all hours of the day and night, so keeping windows open during the hours of sleep is not a good idea because we wake up to a house that stinks.</li><li>Noise and stink from a barbeque that gets fired up at all hours of the day and night.  This is almost directly under our window and on more than one occasion we&#8217;ve been woken up to a room that stinks. The noise isn&#8217;t exactly quiet either!</li><li>Parties up to 5 nights a week. These start from as early as 4pm and go to as late as 4am. A million different people seem to cram into the house next door, and the volume of their activities is just unbearable.</li><li>General noise levels beyond what you&#8217;d expect - ie. seriously taking the piss. We&#8217;ve had stereos cranked so loud that we&#8217;ve had to sleep in other rooms with all the doors and windows closed just so that we can be in a spot quiet enough to give us the chance of falling asleep. Most of the time the music starts early, and goes through until I wake up to go to work in the morning.</li><li>Having to listen to the neighbours in a drunken stupour talk about how many &#8220;bitches&#8221; they&#8217;ve shagged, and what interesting positions they managed to get themselves into. Not really the kind of thing I want to hear while I&#8217;m eating dinner.</li><li>Being parked in. This is one of my favourites. On Easter Sunday we&#8217;d arranged to meet a friend of ours up on the Sunshine Coast to go for a swim and hang out for the day. When we opened up the garage, this is what we found: <a href="/uploads/2007/04/cimg2609.JPG" title="Parked in!" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2007/04/cimg2609.JPG" alt="Parked in!" class="InlineImageCenter" width="256" height="192" /></a>Yup, we were parked in. How nice! It&#8217;s hard to tell from the photo exactly what the scenario was so I&#8217;ll explain.  Our neighbour had some visitors who decided that our garage was actually owned by the people they were visiting. Not only did they not confirm this with the neighbour, they assumed that parking their car on the driveway was fine and that they could leave it there despite there being ample visitors parking exactly the same distance but in the other direction. Said visitors then all crammed into another car and took off, leaving the neighbour&#8217;s driveway completely clear, and our car blocked in.</li></ul>
Some valid questions at this point would be:<ul><li>Why not confront them and ask them to turn it off/down/etc?</li><li>Ask them to move the car</li><li>Ask them to not smoke outside over the clothes line?</li></ul>The short answer to them all is that I tried. At first I was nice about it, it got me nowhere. Sometimes when I knocked on the door they didn&#8217;t answer because they couldn&#8217;t hear me knocking over the volume of the music. Sometimes I&#8217;d ask them to turn it down and they would turn the volume up instead. It was a battle I was never going to win.</p>

<p>As far as the car parking thing goes, I knocked on the door, but noone was home, so the car couldn&#8217;t be moved. I even called the Police to find out if I could have the car towed away on Easter Sunday so we could leave, and  I was told that while it was legal to have it towed to the nearest car park, I&#8217;d have to cover the cost myself - hundreds of dollars to move the car 5 meters isn&#8217;t a good investment in my book. Instead, I roasted them when they returned.</p>

<p>After putting up with this for weeks, I decided it was time to take it to the next step. I spoke to the landlord, and he informed me that the only unit in the entire complex that was not under his management was the one our neighbours were occupying. This put them outside the general rules of the complex and meant that there was nothing he could do other than pass on any complaints to the current property manager.  This turned out to be a good move, because the tenants had moved in to finish off a lease held by someone else who wanted to leave early.  The new tenants were on probation, and they needed to demonstrate that they were good people to have living there otherwise the lease would just expire.</p>

<p>My complaint pretty much ended their chances.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the property manager made sure that the tenants knew that it was I who complained, and hence they took it upon themselves to be as loud and inconsiderate as possible for the rest of their stay. During one encounter not long after, one of the tenants made an idle threat to stab me for getting them kicked out. One of the loud-mouthed friends who was there for another all-night bash decided to have a go at me for &#8220;complaining so bad that it got his friends kicked out&#8221;. So it was a really happy family atmosphere :)</p>

<p>So the level of noise didn&#8217;t drop, if anything it went up. Amy and I have since been travelling the countryside at every opportunity so that we didn&#8217;t have to be at home. We did everything in our power to be away from home as much possible so that we didn&#8217;t have to put up with any shit from the guys next door.</p>

<p>So, after 5 weeks of utter hell, you can imagine our complete joy when we arrived home today to find them leaving! I was under the impression that we were going to have to put up with it for another few weeks, but from what I can see, we&#8217;re finally in the clear.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s just hope that we don&#8217;t get someone worse next time round ;) Anyway, I just wanted to say that if you live in close proximity to other people you should expect to give them a bit of consideration. Firing up music from 11pm to 4am on a working night is just not on.</p>

<p>Have any of you had bad experiences with neighbours?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read lots articles, tutorials and whitepapers whenever I get the chance. Sometimes I&#8217;ll read something and feel enlightened. Other times I finish and feel that I&#8217;ve somehow lost brain cells (please, no jokes about having none to lose ;) ). Recently some of the tutorials I&#8217;ve read on the web have left me feeling extremely underwhelmed. The reasons are because I felt like I didn&#8217;t learn anything or that the tutorial, while hitting the point, didn&#8217;t actually feel like it delivered the kind of information I was expecting. Since going through a few experiences like this I have started to wonder what really makes up a good tutorial, and how does it differ from a &#8216;how-to&#8217; or a whitepaper?</p>

<p>I think that my definition of a tutorial is slightly different from the &#8220;official&#8221; definition, and the one that most other people use. So, here is the obligatory official definition :) (from <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/" title="Dictionary.com" target="_blank">Dictionary.com</a>):<blockquote><p><strong>Tutorial</strong> - tutorial      &#8230; [too-tawr-ee-uhl, -tohr-, tyoo-] &#8230;</p><ol><li>pertaining to or exercised by a tutor: tutorial functions or authority.</li><li>a class in which a tutor gives intensive instruction in some subject to an individual student or a small group of students.</li><li>Computers<ol><li>programmed instruction provided to a user at a computer terminal, often concerning the use of a particular software package and built into that package.</li><li>a manual explaining how to use a particular software package or computer system.</li></ol></li></ol></blockquote>Yup, just as I suspected.</p>

<p>OK, a bit of background information. In many fields a tutorial can be a basic step-by-step to doing something - that I&#8217;m OK with. But I think that there are some areas of my chosen field (that&#8217;d be <em>geekness</em>) where a simple step-by-step just doesn&#8217;t cut it. A really good example of this would be my <a href="/uploads/2007/04/silver-directx-solution-thecolonial.zip" title="DirectX Crackme Solution">solution/tutorial</a> that I <a href="/posts/reversing-directx-blowfish/trackback/" title="Reversing DirectX &amp; Blowfish">previously blogged about</a>. Regardless of who you are, reading a simple tutorial on this topic would show you how to do it, but it wouldn&#8217;t in any way give you the <em>reasons</em> for the steps involved. Now, this solution of mine doesn&#8217;t give a complete set of background information required to understand every step, but it does explain areas that are specific to this problem (along with a few extra snippets to help people learn stuff). So some background knowledge is required, and I think that&#8217;s the big proviso about tutorials - background knowledge.</p>

<p>I try to write my tutorials in such a way that the amount of background knowledge required is minimal without completely modifying the scope of the tutorial. For example, if I were to write a tutorial on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)" title="Polymorphism" target="_blank">polymorphism</a>, I would expect people to have some knowledge of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-Oriented Programming" target="_blank">object orientation</a> and some skills with any form of programming language.  Me being me, I&#8217;d probably use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++" title="C++" target="_blank">C++</a> for my examples, so some understanding of the language and it&#8217;s syntax would also be required.  I may, during the course of the tutorial, discuss some issues that aren&#8217;t directly related to the understanding of polymorphism (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer" title="Pointer" target="_blank">pointer</a> sizes and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_table" title="Virtual Tables" target="_blank">vtables</a>), as I might feel that it aids in understanding more of the world that polymorphism lives in.  It&#8217;s <em>this</em> kind of information that is lacking in most tutorials.</p>

<p>This post was actually inspired by a couple of video tutorials that I watched recently which was designed to show you how to unpack a packed executable, using a few of handy tools (such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger" title="Debugger" target="_blank">debugger</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler" title="Disassembler" target="_blank">disassembler</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" title="Portable Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> explorers). Now, the tutorial (which I&#8217;m not going to link to for fear of pissing off the author!) really cut to the chase. It basically went&#8230;<blockquote><p>Run that, press that, copy that, press that, run that, run this, press that, run that, and you&#8217;re done! Congrats you can now unpack exes packed with <em>X</em>.</p></blockquote>Hardly inspiring. I wondered if the quality of the tutorials was consistant, so I watched another one - again it was on unpacking, but this time it was a different packing algorithm. It was almost exactly the same, the only apparent differences were the names of the exes that were packed, a few memory addresses, and the disassembled code that was visible in the debugger.</p>

<p>This particular individual has uploaded <em>dozens</em> of these tutorials for the world to view, and I really think he/she believes they&#8217;re extremely productive. I can&#8217;t help but think that they&#8217;re not - they could write a single tutorial that covers the theory of unpacking, with one or two examples, and the reader/viewer would actually learn the <em>principles</em> and techniques behind unpacking, rather than just watching someone else press a few buttons in a certain order. I don&#8217;t expect a full run down on what a debugger is, or what reverse engineering is all about, but at least discussing how the packing process works, and <em>why</em> certain steps are taken to unpack the executable would be a very good, and helpful, move. I feel that anything less that this is half-assed!</p>

<p>So, in my world of geekness, a valuable tutorial needs to be more than what the dictionary says a tutorial should be.  In my opinion, it should give you the required knowledge to understand what the tutorial is demonstrating and it should be delivered in such a way that allows the viewer to find it easy to understand the examples along with providing information on how to get access to extra information which may aid in their understanding. The feedback I&#8217;ve had from my previous reverse engineering solution has been great, and it seems that I&#8217;ve covered things in just enough detail to allow people to understand - this may well have been the first time I&#8217;ve achieved it.</p>

<p>Now I realise that some of you may jump on my back and yell &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you practice what you preach!?&#8221;, and you&#8217;d be quite within your rights to do that :) For your information, I intend to do just that. I will be writing some tutorials and lessons on various topics in the coming weeks, and I will be doing my best to cover the subject in as much detail as possible without changing the scope of the work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This tutorial has been on the boil for quite a while.  I got close to nailing the problem late last month, but didn&#8217;t end up finding the time to finish it until this weekend.  This tutorial is a solution to another Crackme, but this time it&#8217;s really not for the faint-hearted.  Information on reversing fullscreen <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/" title="DirectX">DirectX (Direct3D)</a> applications and playing around with <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html" title="Blowfish">Blowfish</a> can be found in this tutorial, and it&#8217;s a bit of a mind-job - it also weighs in at nearly 40 pages (with some nice pictures thrown in)!</p>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="/uploads/2007/04/silverdxcrackme1.zip">Crackme</a> and then <a href="/uploads/2007/04/Silver-DirectX-Solution-TheColonial.zip">my solution</a>. Enjoy.</p>

<h3>Update: 9th Feb 2012</h3>

<p>This tutorial was originally posted and hosted on <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/">Crackmes.de</a> alongside the crackme itself. Unfortunately Crackems.de had been taken offline for quite a while for legal reasons and hence the tutorial wasn&#8217;t available there.</p>

<p>Thanks to issues with webhosts and backup failures, this tutorial was completely unavailable for a long time. Thankfully that site is back up now and I finally have a copy of the tutorial again.</p>

<p>You can still reference the material over on that <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/users/silver/silvers_dx_crackme_1/">site</a>, but I have decided to host a copy of it here as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just like many things in life, the Internet is full of fads and fashions.  There have been stacks of them in the past, and no doubt there&#8217;ll be stacks more.  At the moment, the current fads are Social Networking, Blogging and &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221;.  A few years back, the Internet was completely bombarded with forums.  They were everywhere, open for discussion about anything from software and development through to what people were doing on the weekend.  Yes, I even created my own! It was a game development forum, designed for discussion of all things related to game development and the challenges faced in the engineering of games.  It was great fun, and after a few months of &#8220;marketing&#8221;, I actually had a groovey little community posting regularly and having some very interesting discussions.</p>

<p>For reasons that are beyond the scope of this post, I decided to hand my community over to my co-founder and move onto other things.  It was at this point I took a very long break from reading and posting on forums, mainly because I was getting sick of answering the same questions over and over again.  Such is the nature of forums, you&#8217;re always going to attract <em>some</em> idiots, and there&#8217;s only so many times you can listen to someone say &#8220;I&#8217;ve figured out how to print out a string to the screen, can you please tell me how to make Quake 6?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Until recently, the only time I&#8217;d checked out a forum since then is during my search for snippets of information with regards to new technology, software fixes, development information or other similar bits and pieces. I didn&#8217;t really feel the need to contribute the communities that I was perusing - but I did start wondering whether or not active forum communities are still a huge part of the web.</p>

<p>Now, that may seem like an obvious question since I have already stated that I&#8217;ve grabbed a lot of information from them, but I&#8217;d like to know what percentage of the &#8216;Net population actually uses them or contributes to them?  In the time I&#8217;ve been a web user, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people get sick of forums, and have moved away (possibly never to return) and I&#8217;m wondering if they&#8217;ll continue on the way they are.  The first generation of forum users seem to have moved onto blogging, and forums are now full of the next generation of Interweb users searching for information without intuition telling them to use Google.</p>

<p>FYI, I&#8217;ve just started posting/helping out at the <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/forum/" title="Kirupa" target="_blank">Kirupa forums</a>, and I get the feeling that I&#8217;ll get sick of it quickly for the same reasons I got sick of it back in the early 2000s :) I think on the whole I prefer writing blogs, posting comments on blogs, and writing how-tos or tutorials on what I figure is interesting stuff.  Is there much of a difference between that and forum posting? I think there is :)</p>

<p>So what do you think? Are you, or were you, a forum user?  Will they be completely superseded by blogs, or will they continue to keep their litlte part of the &#8216;Net just for themselves?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, it&#8217;s that time of the year again - time to move servers! I hope that this is going to be the last one for quite some time as I&#8217;m getting sick of it :)  The current set up looks to be a good one and I can&#8217;t (at the moment) see why we&#8217;d need to change it again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was sent an interesting link this morning by <a href="http://pervivere.blogspot.com/" title="Simon Shea" target="_blank">Simon</a> that I think you guys will find quite interesting too (especially those of you with a passion for human/computer interaction <em>cough</em> <strong>Dan</strong> <em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>Introducing the <a href="http://www.bumptop.com/" title="BumpTop 3D Desktop" target="_blank">BumpTop 3D Desktop</a>, a crazy new way of interacting with your machine and handling documents/files.  Check out the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ODskdEPnQ" title="BumpTop" target="_blank">YouTube</a> vid to see how it works:</p>

<object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/M0ODskdEPnQ"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/M0ODskdEPnQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object>


<p>Pretty groovey hey!  Of course, this looks like it was designed to work moreso with hand-held or tablet PCs (the &#8220;pressure&#8221; gestures are a bit of a give-away there), but it&#8217;d be cool to see something like this on a desktop machine.</p>

<p>I do wonder if this kind of mechanism would be more intuitive to a user though.  While it looks cool and makes a bit of sense (based on the description), I think using it would be slow compared to the conventional desktop.  What do you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Isn&#8217;t it amazing how life can just hit turbo without prior warning, and your time seems to just disappear!  I need to find some way of sticking blogging back into my routine :)</p>

<p>For the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been playing around a fair bit with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails" target="_blank">Rails</a>.  I&#8217;ve been having a great deal of fun at the same time, and I recommend it to any of you who are thinking of taking up some of your own time with learning web development.  It&#8217;s really good fun, it&#8217;s interesting, and it&#8217;s a great platform for building web apps on.  Sure it has its pitfalls (as do all web development options), but it&#8217;s a worthy contender and it&#8217;s only going to get better.  More on that in another post ;)</p>

<p>The reason I mentioned it is because of the news that ASP.NET has an <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/posts/Big-News-_2D00_-MVC-framework-for-ASP.NET-in-the-works-_2D00_-level-300.aspx">MVC framework in the works</a>, which looks like it&#8217;s going to be very similar to the way Rails works.  I think this is a good thing as it&#8217;ll force people to move away from an (possibly) unnecessary <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/08/DesignPatterns/default.aspx" title="MVP" target="_blank">MVP</a> approach (for most things) and work with a well-structured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller" title="MVC" target="_blank">MVC</a> (which a surprising amount of developers don&#8217;t yet know about!).</p>

<p>No doubt this is another effort by Microsoft to rip off some code from <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html" title="MonoRail" target="_blank">another established project</a> and claim it as their own, but still if it works and works well, then I&#8217;m not really complaining.</p>

<p>Anyway, what do you guys think? Is this a good or a bad thing?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember when I was in high school as a teenager and all I wanted to &#8216;be&#8217; was a Software Engineer.  I was one of those lucky people who always seemed to know what it is they wanted to do, and for me it was always going to be creating software.  I got stuck into a plethora of coding projects in my own time while finishing school which, along with doing &#8220;Computer Studies&#8221; for the last 3 years, gave me a pretty solid grounding to build on when I got to University.</p>

<p>When I finally started my study of Computer Science at Uni I found many of the subjects very easy - particularly the programming ones.  In fact, they become boring very quickly due to the fact that it felt like I was just learning new syntax.  Syntax is always the easy/boring bit, it&#8217;s the understanding of the programming constructs that&#8217;s the key&#8230; but I digress.</p>

<p>So to keep myself interested, I decided to pick a couple of topics that I&#8217;d always been interested in.  Yes, they&#8217;re very cliched, but the topics I chose were:<ul><li>Software Security &amp; Reverse Engineering</li><li>Computer Graphics &amp; Game Programming</li></ul>Both of these fields had always been fascinating to me, so I decided to take some of the time that I had set aside for study and pump it into these two topics.</p>

<p>An uber-geek was born.</p>

<p>As I progressed through my study I was fortunate enough to land myself a full-time job in a software development company.  I started off working in the testing area, and quickly moved into development.  The application I worked on was an accounting and practice management system, and I was using C++ and VB on a daily basis.  I thought I&#8217;d found utopia!  I was finally in a paid programming job, what else could there possibly be in life?</p>

<p>Unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t utopia.  After a fairly short period of time, I found myself becoming disinterested in what I was doing.  Accountancy wasn&#8217;t interesting, the application wasn&#8217;t interesting, the workplace wasn&#8217;t interesting, there was no life in the developers around me - it was a completely stagnant place to be.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until that point that I realised that just being a programmer wasn&#8217;t enough.  I had always thought that I&#8217;d be happy writing code of any kind, so long as I was writing code.  But I was completely wrong.  If you don&#8217;t work in a field that you find interesting it becomes extremely hard to remain focussed or even become mildly excited about going to work.  If you don&#8217;t feel excited or interested in what you do, then you&#8217;re bound to end up unhappy.  The bane of full-time work is that it takes up so much of your life that it&#8217;s very hard not to be affected by it.  So if you want to be happy, it&#8217;s a good idea to find work that you like!</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned I love working with graphics, gaming, security and reverse engineering (no doubt you&#8217;ve gathered that from some of the recent posts!).  Unfortunately these fields are all very difficult to get involved in professionally and they require a <strong>lot</strong> of ground work.  When I decided to chase one of these two fields professionally, I chose the graphics and gaming option because of the satisfaction of seeing things come alive.  I won&#8217;t go into all the reasons for me being passionate about this line of work as it&#8217;s worthy of it&#8217;s own post.  Suffice is to say that it was appealing enough for me to alter the course of my career to chase it.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s part of the reason I did my stint in the UK.  Getting into the games industry here in Australia proved to be a real bitch.  It is still quite tight, and unless you have contacts in the industry or some experience from elsewhere, your chances of getting a foot in the door are pretty slim.  In the end, the travel, the bad weather, the awful pay cut and the 2 years away from my home land were worth it.  I worked in games with some fantastic people and it was an amazing experience.</p>

<p>Life is too short to be working in a field which you don&#8217;t enjoy.  So if you&#8217;re not happy, do something about it!</p>

<p>And finally we come to the point(s) of the post.  Do you like what you do?  Have you found a job that you find interesting, and is it something that you <em>can</em> get excited about?  Do you struggle to get up in the morning and motivate yourself to charge into the day ahead because you&#8217;re not that keen to get to work?</p>

<p>For those of you who are geeks, what areas of the computer world do you find interesting?  Are you working as an I.T. professional but hate it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.iitac.org/" title="IITAC.org" target="_blank"><img src="http://certification.iitac.org/templates/default/images/HeaderIcon.png" class="InlineImageLeft" alt="IITAC.org" /></a>Yes, you can (most probably) consider this to be a fairly regular segment from this point on :) As I said before I&#8217;ve always been partial to RCE, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get sick of it.  Today&#8217;s installment is another tutorial that I felt shouldn&#8217;t be published.  The reason is because it&#8217;s a tutorial on how to solve an example reversing challenge for the <a href="http://certification.iitac.org/goto.php?target=cat_384&client_id=iitac" title="" target="_blank">IITAC online RCE adacemy</a>, and I generally don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good move to show other people how to do this stuff when they can get certified for it. However, this is just a <em>training</em> example so I think I&#8217;m safe.</p>

<p>The challenge consists of a few tasks:<ol><li>Removing a nag-screen</li><li>Finding a hard-coded serial number</li><li>Finding a valid name/serial combination</li><li>Writing a key generator</li></ol>You&#8217;ll notice from the tutorial that the full source code is included written in 32-bit ASM.  Again, I would appreciate the feedback on the quality from anyone who wishes to give it (that includes you Alister ;) ) as I&#8217;m always looking to improve what I write.</p>

<p>You can grab it from <a href="/uploads/2007/03/01-course-splish-2.zip" title="Course 01 - Splish 2 reversing solution">here</a>.</p>
