  <div class="entry-content"><p>My eternal quest for maximising productivity has recently lead me in the direction of an interesting new application called <a href="http://they.misled.us/dark-room" title="DarkRoom" target="_blank">DarkRoom</a>. Some of you may have heard of this before, and will consider it &lsquo;old news&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;m sure there are some readers out there who wouldn&rsquo;t have heard of it and I feel it&rsquo;s worth pointing out.</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/2007/05/darkroom.png" title="DarkRoom" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2007/05/darkroom_thumb.png" alt="DarkRoom" class="InlineImageRight" /></a>In short, DarkRoom is designed to do one thing; and that&rsquo;s <strong>minimise distractions</strong>. It&rsquo;s a simple text-editor which takes up your entire screen, covering everything incuding the toolbar and system tray, and leaves you with nothing but a blinking cursor. When you first fire it up you&rsquo;ll find that it closely resembles Keanu Reeves&#8217; computer screen at the start of <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/" title="The Matrix" target="_blank">The Matrix</a>, and you might find yourself waiting for the message: <em>Wake up Neo.</em> When you see the colour-scheme you&rsquo;ll know exactly what I mean (check out the screenshot).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since we&rsquo;ve been home from the U.K., Amy and I have been keeping tabs on the property market in the hope of finding a place that we&rsquo;d be keen to buy. We&rsquo;ve been renting ever since we&rsquo;ve known each other, and I started renting over 10 years ago. This probably won&rsquo;t come as a surprise, but I&rsquo;m bloody sick of renting!</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that I&rsquo;m lining the pockets of my landlord, I don&rsquo;t like the idea that the money we&rsquo;re putting into our living arrangements is just dead. We won&rsquo;t ever see it again. So, it&rsquo;s now well past the time that we found our own place.</p>

<p>One would have thought that finding a house to buy would be a <em>relatively</em> easy thing to do, but given the state of the property market here in Brisbane, it&rsquo;s proven to be a very tough thing to do. The market here has been so buoyant for the last few years that prices have gone through the roof. There are currently 1200 (approx) people moving to South-East Queensland every <strong>week</strong>, and hence there is a dire need for housing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most common questions asked by would-be coders is &ldquo;<em>which language should I learn first?</em>&rdquo;. The answer isn&rsquo;t really straight forward. I think it varies depending on age, aptitude, how well you know computers, your passion and what you want to do with what you learn.</p>

<p>On hearing this question recently, I decided to avoid my usual response and actually put a bit of thought into how <em>I</em> learned to code, to see if the method is still feasible, then resopnd accordingly. I set about reading a few blogs, doing a few searches for bits and pieces that I used to play with, and playing with how easy it is to get a simple language/compiler fired up on the &ldquo;latest &lsquo;n&rsquo; greatest&rdquo; PCs that we have available today. I was surprised to find that things really have changed. A <em>lot</em>.</p>

<p>The first time I ever dabbled in any form of coding (and in this case I&rsquo;m using the word &ldquo;coding&rdquo; in its broadest possible sense) was when I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE" target="_blank" title="Peek and Poke">peeked and poked</a> on the second computer I ever owned &ndash; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" title="Commodore 64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a>. This was in the very early days for me, and I have to admit I didn&rsquo;t really understand everything that was going on (arguably, I still don&rsquo;t :D ), but it really gave me a taste of how things were, and what was required to make all those funky games that I used to play as a kid.</p>

<p>My lack of understanding was my motivation at this point. How did those guys manage to make such rich worlds and exciting games for these computers using such obscure codes and commands? A curiosity got hold of me, and I set about to learn how it was done. A few years flew by before I really started to grasp what was going on, this was partly because I wasn&rsquo;t able to get my hands on a new machine until the early 90s. A few friends here and there had computers at home (usually an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad" title="Amstrad" target="_blank">Amstrad</a>) and at primary school we&rsquo;d have time here and there for dabbling on the computers, but in general I failed to achieve anything substantial.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps I&rsquo;m being too hard on myself. I guess I <em>felt</em> that what I was doing was fairly insignificant despite it being a bit more than what the other kids were doing, and it was a real point of frustration for me. I wanted to make the hard stuff like the big boys did, but with the tools and the time that I had, I never really managed to get anywhere near where I wanted to go.</p>

<p>Then things changed dramatically. In late 1990, my family and I moved from the sleepy town of Hayle in Cornwall, England to what was then a nice coastal town called Nowra on the South Coast of NSW, Australia. The move was fairly drastic, and to help with the transition, my parents bought me a new computer &ndash; an Intel-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286" title="80286" target="_blank">80286</a> IBM compatible! It came with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS" title="MS-DOS" target="_blank">MS-DOS</a> (I think it was version 5.0) installed and a small selection of software (some games and a few little apps for admin stuff such as writing documents and dealing with spreadsheets).</p>

<p>As excited as I was about my new toy, I was partly torn between it and the new wonderful world that could be experienced outside. Australia really is an amazing place to be, especially when you&rsquo;ve originally grown up in England, and the outside life really was fun&hellip; but I digress&hellip;</p>

<p>I utilised the hours of darkness to feed my need to learn how this magic box actually worked. After spending a fair bit of time mastering the basics (you wouldn&rsquo;t believe how many times I managed to completely smash my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT" title="autoexec.bat" target="_blank">autoexec.bat</a> and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONFIG.SYS" title="config.sys" target="_blank">config.sys</a> files while trying new and wonderful ways to boot multiple configurations while minimising the amount of conventional memory being used), I somehow stumbled across a program that I didn&rsquo;t know existed, but later found out that it (or a variation of it) had existed for a very long time.</p>

<p>This program was single-handedly responsible for <em>many</em> late nights and lots of abuse from my family to &ldquo;get off that bloody computer&rdquo;. I quickly developed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic" title="QBasic" target="_blank">QBasic</a> addiction.</p>

<p>This is where it all started to make sense. I spent hours and hours learning the fundamentals of the language. My parents bought me the official <a href="http://www.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?qwork=7106212&matches=10&qsort=r" title="MS-DOS QBasic Programmers Reference" target="_blank">MS-DOS QBasic Programmers Reference</a> so that I didn&rsquo;t have to constantly switch to the help file to figure out what I should be doing! I ripped apart the source code or <a href="http://telcontar.net/Misc/Gorillas/Gorillas.bas" title="Gorrilas.bas" target="_blank">Gorrilas.bas</a> and <a href="http://www.shiar.org/product/nibbles.bas" title="nibbles.bas" target="_blank">Nibbles.bas</a> to see how the masters used the language, and over a fairly short time I managed to crank out quite a few cool applications and games.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s now many years since I last played with QBasic, but I have to say that if it wasn&rsquo;t for this language, and the fact that it came for free with the computer, I <em>possibly</em> wouldn&rsquo;t have got into software as a profession or perhaps even gained the level of experience that I have gained.</p>

<p>And finally we arrive at the key point! Back on those days, even though we didn&rsquo;t have ready access to the web, we still had something like QBasic that shipped with the computer that could be used by those of us who wanted to learn. We had the means to learn to write code in a relatively complex yet simple language without really having to search far and wide for it. It was there, it was easy enough to pick up, and we even had a mini development environment there ready to be used to aid in our development. We didn&rsquo;t have a plethora of opinions being thrown at us through forums and blogs telling us that C, C++, Lisp, Prolog, Miranda, Eiffel or Pascal are the languages to learn if you want to do something serious (I admit, I&rsquo;ve been a culprit for this when I haven&rsquo;t really thought much about the person who is looking to learn).</p>

<p>It seems that anyone who has an interest in the black arts of coding is now told to go and learn a high-level language with proper object-orientation with all the bells and whistles so that you don&rsquo;t learn any bad habits. This recommendation <em>might</em> be a good option, but again this depends on the person.</p>

<p>In my exploration of this topic, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as the &lsquo;ideal&rsquo; language for everyone to learn first. But I do think that there are one or two that are stand-out contenders to get people off the ground.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to put together a small list of languages matched up with different types of people at different levels of ability, different ages and different goals. This list contains my view on which languages fit with those people, and why. I might be wrong, but hey, it&rsquo;s my opinion that I&rsquo;m expressing, so feel free to express yours too using the comment form. It&rsquo;s not exhaustive, and isn&rsquo;t designed to cover every language on the planet. I hope that this helps some of the budding developers choose a target language and make the most of the time that they spend learning.</p>

<p><strong><u>QBasic</u></strong>
<em>Download Link</em>: <a href="http://www.qbasic.com/"><a href="http://www.qbasic.com/">http://www.qbasic.com/</a></a>
<em>Remarks</em>: This is an excellent language to learn for almost anyone. It&rsquo;s procedural which negates the need to have an understanding of object orientation, and is a language which gives results quickly. One thing that&rsquo;s very disheartening for budding coders is when they feel they put in a lot of work without seeing a result. QBasic is easy enough to get results quickly, hence keeping up the motivation of the learner, but it still powerful enough to do some fun stuff with. One thing that I love about QBasic is that it has a mini development environment and debugger built in &ndash; which is something you don&rsquo;t see in many languages!</p>

<p><strong><u>C</u></strong>
<em>Download Link</em>: <a href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml"><a href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml">http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml</a></a>
<em>Remarks</em>: A very powerful procedural language which has been around for a very long time. The knowledge base for this language is immense, and hence there&rsquo;s a stack of material to learn from. It can be quite difficult to grasp some of the concepts when using C, and the learner is forced to dabble with some things which may be confusing even from the word go (eg. passing the address of integer variables to <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/scanf.html" title="scanf" target="_blank">scanf</a>). It&rsquo;s a great language, and definitely worth learning, but would be more suited to those people who have a decent grasp of programming concepts. If you have experience with another language, such as QBasic, then C would be a good next step. If you decide to take on C as a first language, expect to do a fair bit of work before you start to see the results. Setting an environment up for development can be a pain depending on the compiler and platform you&rsquo;re using.</p>

<p><strong><u>C++</u></strong>
<em>Download Link</em>: <a href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml"><a href="http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml">http://www.thefreecountry.com/compilers/cpp.shtml</a></a>
<em>Remarks</em>: C++ was born from the lessons learned from C. It&rsquo;s an object-oriented language that still lets you write procedural code (not a good thing IMHO), but that&rsquo;s mainly due to the need for backwards compatilibity with C. C++ can be easy to learn for those with an idea of object orientation, or who have a good working knowledge of C. If you&rsquo;re a first-timer then I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily consider using this language unless you have a strong grounding in maths and logic, or if you have a mentor to help you learn. Generally people who want to learn C++ intend to use it for more than just home projects, and hence it&rsquo;s a good idea to have some form of tuition &ndash; mainly to help stomp out bad habits and to make sure you don&rsquo;t write a stack of tightly-coupled and unmanagable procedural C-style code :) Take this on as a second or third language unless you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous. Like C, this can be a pain to get working with, and generally isn&rsquo;t as simple as &ldquo;type and run&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;re looking to get going with a language quickly, again, go with QBasic. If you want to be a game developer, right now you&rsquo;d be stupid not to learn C++ &ndash; it&rsquo;s almost an industry &ldquo;standard&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong><u>PHP</u></strong>
<em>Download Link</em>: <a href="http://www.php.net/"><a href="http://www.php.net/">http://www.php.net/</a></a>
<em>Remarks</em>: A cross-platform dynamic/scripting language. This language is a mix of procedural and object-oriented languages, and seems to be a mixture of a stack of other languages all in one (there are elements of C, C++, and even scripting thrown into it). It&rsquo;s generally used for web-based applications, though it&rsquo;s not the only thing it can be used for. I would recommend learning this as a first language in a web environment, but if you&rsquo;re new to programming, stick with something that can run locally. Setting up PHP can be a pain regardless of the platform, and because it requires a webserver to be running as well as the interpreter there are more possible points of failure. Debugging can be a difficult and therefore a deterrant for people who get frustrated easily. This language is valuable, but take this on when you&rsquo;ve got a good idea about programming in general and have an understanding of issues that are faced by applications in a web environment.</p>

<p><strong><u>Ruby</u></strong>
<em>Download Link</em>: <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/"><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/</a></a>
<em>Remarks</em>: Another cross-platform dynamic/scripting language. Still in it&rsquo;s infancy, yet already very stable with a large user base. Fairly intuitive, but that might be just for those people with a programming background. Worth a look for anyone looking to find a good scripting language for menial tasks and for things such as build processes. Coupled with Rails (<a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">http://www.rubyonrails.org/</a>) it becomes a powerful rapid applicaiton development framework for web-based applications. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it as a starting language, primarily because of the toolset that has to be used.</p>

<p><strong><u>Visual Basic</u></strong>
<em>Download Link</em>: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vb/"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vb/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/vb/</a></a>
<em>Remarks</em>: Worst language ever :) But I guess every language has its place. This is good for rapid prototyping, and is a good way for QBasic developers to get an idea of how to build Windows GUI applications. It&rsquo;s not something I would recommend to anyone who is looking to get themselves into serious coding, as the language has so many flaws it makes doing things &ldquo;properly&rdquo; particularly difficult.
<em>Disclaimer</em>: I realise that the language has changed a bit since the early days, but I still think that learning something like C# would be a better option for Windows applications. I personally feel that VB no longer has a place. Again, that&rsquo;s just me :)</p>

<p><strong><u>C#</u></strong>

<em>Remarks</em>: A better alternative to VB, and quite nice to use. Good for both web and windows applications, but again requires some background knowledge (particularly for web apps). It&rsquo;s fully object-oriented and very well designed. Take this language on if you&rsquo;re looking to move into a professional position building enterprise applications. It could be a good option as a first language, but I think there are easier options. Most people with a background in C, C++ or Java will find this language very easy to pick up. The development environment is nice, but not necessarily intuitive to new developers, so a few tutorials would need to be read to learn how to move around the IDE before any serious development work could be undertaken.</p>

<em>Remarks</em>: Depending on who you speak to, this is the language that Microsoft ripped off when creating C# ;) I&rsquo;m not sure if I agree or not. Either way, it&rsquo;s a cross-platform language that can be used for web and GUI applications. The virtual machine runs on different platforms so you have the added benefit of having your app run on different platforms without the need to write extra code. It&rsquo;s object-oriented, and has a very rich framework of tools and libraries. It&rsquo;s quite intuitive, and has a large user base with a great deal of knowledge. The guys in the Java world, at least until now, have generally been leading the way in areas such as unit testing, mocking and other agile principles, and hence the community is fairly active. Finding information, tutorials and people to help you would be easy with this language, but be prepared for a little bit of a learning curve to get going. A good first language, but possibly not the best. Definitely worth learning if you want to build web applications, or even mobile phone games!</p>

<p>As a final note, I&rsquo;d like to point out that I left functional languages (such as Miranda and Haskell) out because I think they&rsquo;re too confusing for new developers :) That doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re valuable.</p>

<p>Please let me know your view, and feel free to give us a run down on how you started writing code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you all know, I recently moved the Blackapache site to a new server. We had some teething issues, as ya do when making the move, but all is now well. One of the things that I hadn&rsquo;t got round to fixing was my <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/" title="SpamAssassin" target="_blank">SpamAssassin</a> installation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d already gone through the fun times of setting up email (POP3s, IMAP4s) with <a href="http://www.qmail.org/" target="_blank" title="Qmail">Qmail</a>, which after a bit of time (and a learning curve) was working fine (with SSL, hence the &rsquo;s&#8217; at the end of the names ;) ) and all my users were able to send/receive without an issues. While trying to set it up, I was having issues getting both SpamAssassin and <a href="http://www.clamav.net/" title="Clam AV" target="_blank">Clam AntiVirus</a> working. Both of the daemons would run fine, but I just couldn&rsquo;t quite get the configuration right.</p>

<p>Thankfully, AV isn&rsquo;t so much of an issue as my users all have AV protection on their local machines. Spam, while annoying, can be lived with until I find the time to get the filters working properly &ndash; so I basically left these two things alone for a while until I found the time after doing all the other <em>urgent</em> bits.</p>

<p>I finally got round to making an attempt to fix the problem a weekend or so ago, but still couldn&rsquo;t get it to behave. I read forum upon forum, blog upon blog, and readme upon readme, but for some reason the bloody thing just refused to work. I got frustrated, reverted all the settings back to how they were before, and gave up for the day.</p>

<p>During the last week I was prepping myself for another attempt at getting it work, when I heard about <a href="http://www.google.com/a/" title="Google Apps" target="_blank">Google Apps</a>. I was a bit surprised when I first read all the details, because it was the first time I&rsquo;d heard about it! Being a geek I thought I was pretty good with keeping up to speed, and I was a bit narked with myself for letting this golden nugget slip through the net.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go through the ins and outs of what Google Apps is all about as there are already a <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=google+apps" title="Google Apps Search" target="_blank">stack</a> of pages out there already talking about it. What I will say is that I should have made the move earlier!</p>

<p>Not only do I no longer have to worry about keeping my entire email configuration (Qmail with vpopmail and courier imap, SpamAssassin, ClamAV, Horde/SquirrelMail) up to date and patched, I don&rsquo;t even have to have it running. The &ldquo;precious&rdquo; resources on the server can now be utilised for other things such as an <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="SubVersion" target="_blank">SVN</a> install. Each email user has 2GB of space, webmail comes for free and has the fantastic facilities that come with <a href="http://www.gmail.com/" target="_blank" title="Gmail">Gmail</a>. Users can easily configure their own accounts, handle their own password changes, etc. My administration of email has basically dropped to just above zero. The only thing I need to do as an administrator is get the account set up initially, the rest is up to the user.</p>

<p>You can probably tell that I&rsquo;m quite excited about this. It&rsquo;s great that I don&rsquo;t have to worry about this any more, and I can put more time and effort into other things.  Of course, my excitement only extends as far as email for now, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that over time I&rsquo;ll also come to love the added features of <a href="http://calendar.google.com/" title="Google Calendar" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com/" title="Google Calendar" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a>.</p>

<p>This service does come with its limitations, and with the possibility of Google Datamining, but for a home server which I use for a blog, having this facility to lighten the admin load is just fantastic.</p>

<p>I highly recommend considering this as an option if you&rsquo;re looking to sort out an email host! Give it a trial, at least for a while, and you may find you&rsquo;re as happy as I am. If you don&rsquo;t like it, you can always revert back to your old setup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last day or so, stacks of people have been hammering <a href="http://www.digg.com/" title="Digg" target="_blank">digg</a> as a revolt against their recent actions.  For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, HD-DVD encryption was cracked recently and the master key which allows all movies to be ripped has been released across the web. Digg, in their infinite wisdom, decided to kill off the original blog post (and apparently banned one or two users? &ndash; unconfirmed), resulting in an avalanche of posts preaching &ldquo;free speach&rdquo; and &ldquo;fuck you Digg&rdquo;. Digg is now being dugg big time, and as a tool it&rsquo;s being used as a weapon against itself.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting issue. Digg are obviously in a position where they have to remove anything that may be considered an infringment of copyright, otherwise they could be subject to hefty lawsuits which could result in the site being closed (have a read of <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=73" title="What's happening with the HD-DVD stories?" target="_blank">this</a> for a bit more information), but by the same token it almost goes against their whole business idea &ndash; sharing information that people want to have shared in a democratic fashion.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the encryption key is just a bunch of numbers, and most people have a problem with the idea that a bunch of numbers can be patented/copyrighted. I have to say that I agree with them. A number is a number, it exists in so many forms, and can have so many meanings. Trying to prevent people from posting these numbers is a waste of time. There are some smart people out there using some pretty <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/191/480556169_6d731d2416_o.jpg" target="_blank">funny</a> and clever ways to post the number without actually stating that the number is the encryption key &ndash; which is perfectly legal.</p>

<p>Regardless of the politics, the cat is out of the bag. And from this point on, the &lsquo;Net community will no doubt be pushing to <a href="http://rudd-o.com/archives/posts/spread-this-number/" title="Spread this Number" target="_blank">spread this number</a> as far and as wide as possible.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

<p>Edit: Kaz just sent me <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/product/235658543735065663" target="_blank">this awesome link</a>. I wonder if they&rsquo;d have the power to rip the shirt off your back?!</p>

<p>Edit 2: So, the masses have been heard! Digg has <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=74" target="_blank">changed its tune</a> and will no longer be attempting to stop said key being shared. Hats off to them for taking a stance. The thing is, whether they try to stop it or not, the encryption key will <em>not</em> be removed from the web &ndash; it&rsquo;s out there, and people won&rsquo;t let it be brushed under the carpet.</p>

<p>Edit 3: Couldn&rsquo;t resist posting <a href="http://www.openjesus.org/2007/the-key" title="They Key" target="_blank">this</a>, it&rsquo;s bloody awesome (I&rsquo;m talking about the pic).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone who uses the web knows how to use Google to find stuff. Well, at least they <em>think</em> they do. Googling is pretty easy, but it&rsquo;s also a bit of an art form. Some people just seem to have the &lsquo;knack&rsquo; of finding things quickly, others take a fair bit of time.</p>

<p>So what makes a good Google search? How do you arrange your search string in such a way to allow the best hits to come up first? Or at least to help you find the info you&rsquo;re looking for quickly without wading through the besquillion results?</p>

<p>I consider myself to be a pretty good Googler. It doesn&rsquo;t take me long at all to find the bits of information I&rsquo;m looking for. Here are some things to bear in mind while searching which may help you improve your hit rate while searching for things:<ul><li><strong>Change the order of your search words.</strong>If you have a two word search term (say &ldquo;OJ rant&rdquo;), you&rsquo;ll get different sets of results if you search for <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=oj+rant&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8" title="Search: OJ rant" target="_blank">OJ rant</a> instead of <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=rant+oj&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8" title="Search: rant OJ" target="_blank">rant OJ</a>. Depending on the words in the search term, the results could be profoundly different. The best thing to do is start with words that better qualify what it is you&rsquo;re searching for. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re looking for information on Firefox errors, it&rsquo;d be better to search for <strong>Firefox error</strong> as opposed to <strong>error firefox</strong> because the first term gives a better context and hence a more focussed set of search results. Errors are fairly broad and appear in stacks of places, but Firefox is quite specific.</li><li><strong>Use quotes to connect words together.</strong> When you&rsquo;re using a phrase or set of words which are linked together, and you know that they appear in a certain order, then use quotes to force a search for those words in that order. An example might be where you&rsquo;re searching for song lyrics and you don&rsquo;t know the artist or the song name.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be scared to use a long search term.</strong> It&rsquo;s quite surprising that lots of people for some reason feel that they can&rsquo;t stick in a really long search term. I&rsquo;ve lost count of the amount of times I&rsquo;ve come across a really long error which I&rsquo;ve pasted directly into a Google search (with quotes ;) ) resulting in excellent results first time out. Chances are that if you&rsquo;re looking at something like that, Google&rsquo;s indexed some information on it, so why deprive it of all that criteria when you search? The information is there, so use it.</li><li><strong>Force the use of common words.</strong> Google strips out common words when you perform your search (examples are &lsquo;the&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;to&rsquo;, etc), so that it doesn&rsquo;t return every site on the Internet in every search result set. If you&rsquo;re not getting the information you need, and you feel that one of those terms is the key to that information, then force the word (or phrase) to be included by prefixing it with a &lsquo;+&rsquo; sign. A common one for me here is the use of <strong>com</strong>. The word &lsquo;com&rsquo; appears in ever site that has a .com <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain" title="Top-level Domain" target="_blank">TLD</a>, and so Google strips it out. But in my geek travels I search for information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_object_model" title="Component Object Model" target="_blank">COM</a> fairly regularly. So I search for <strong>+COM</strong> to make sure the word &lsquo;com&rsquo; is used without being removed.</li><li><strong>Give your searches extra context.</strong> If you&rsquo;re getting a stack of results which don&rsquo;t seem to relate to what you&rsquo;re looking for, then choose a few words which give more meaning to the item you&rsquo;re searching for and put them <em>before</em> your current search term.</li><li><strong>Cull words if needed.</strong> Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have a word or two in your search which actually help in muddying the waters. If you&rsquo;re not getting desired results using different ordering of the same search terms, then drop one or two off and see how that can affect it.</li><li><strong>Use a tabbed browser!</strong> I can&rsquo;t stress this enough :) It&rsquo;s a bit different to the other points and is more focussed on going through the links that the search has returned, but trying to read a plethora of links without tabbing is just a nighmare. So get yourself a copy of <a href="http://www.getfirfox.com/" title="Get Firefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and utilise the CTRL key ;)</li></ul>Many of you will read this post and think &ldquo;yeah well no sh*t Einstein!&rdquo;, and if you do, then it means you&rsquo;re already able to search for stuff yourself :) But you&rsquo;d be surprised how few people out there really know how to leverage the power of Google.</p>

<p>There are million sites out there with in-depth coverage of the features of the Google search engine, which isn&rsquo;t really the target of this post, and hence I&rsquo;m not going to link them or discuss them. The idea is to get you going with smarter search terms while utilising a small subset of Google&rsquo;s search term power.  If you&rsquo;re looking for more information, you know where to find it :)</p>
