<p>The thing that annoys me about this is that it was written by the <em>lead/architect</em>! The man who should know the framework like the back of his hand. Scary stuff. It&#8217;s this kind of thing that inspired my comments about &#8220;knowing your tech&#8221; in my post about the day job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sure that everyone knew that this was going to happen at some stage. Whether or not they believed it&#8217;d happen so quickly is another matter. Either way, it&#8217;s official, the new wonderdumpling operating system from Microsoft has been cracked. Aparently the activation and installation of the whole thing has been bypassed, and it&#8217;s available on the web. Check out <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/vista-gold-but-cracked-already/posts/1163266532925.html" title="Vista gold but cracked already - BizTech - Technology - smh.com.au" target="_blank">this SMH article</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Why do they bother? Microsoft&#8217;s software is always going to be a target for hackers and crackers, and I think it&#8217;d be a better use of time and resources if they focussed on improving the user experience and giving the user more control and power when using the OS instead of trying to labotomise the machine if the software is cracked (and hence causing a crapload of problems for <em>legit</em> users) then they&#8217;d find that their users would be happier and they wouldn&#8217;t end up with so much egg on the face!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some overseas boffins have come up with a new way of punching text into a mobile phone, though I&#8217;m not sure I like it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VMoAZNRe1I" title="YouTube - examples with the mobile qwerty layout" target="_blank">This YouTube video</a> shows examples of how they propose to deal with the typing into a phone keypad in a QWERTY-like manner.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t see it catching on, and I really can&#8217;t see companies like Nokia adopting something like this either. I think it&#8217;d be a bit of a mind-job to learn, and not particularly intuitive as it almost requires you to know the QWERTY keyboard layout before you can type. Let&#8217;s face it, the average Joe isn&#8217;t going to be learning the QWERTY layout just so he can type into his phone. It&#8217;s a neat idea, but I think it&#8217;ll become vapour.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see that there are people out there still trying to find new and interesting ways for us to interact with technology, and I&#8217;m still hoping that someone will find something a replacement for this bloody keyboard very soon.<blockquote>&#8220;Computer? Hello, computer?&#8221;
&#8220;Just use the keyboard.&#8221;
&#8220;A keyboard? How quaint!&#8221;</blockquote></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This would have to be close to the dumbest way of verifying the state of a connection :) Well, that might not be true, but it&#8217;s definitely one of the dumbest ways.</p>

<p>This is a funky snippet of code that was extracted from a system I&#8217;m doing some work on at the moment:</p>

<p>So, if it doesn&#8217;t hurl an exception at you, it&#8217;s valid! Nice work eh? So if you have to check for exceptions anyway, why not just try using the connection in the first place and handle THAT exception instead?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you might not know about <a href="http://www.thewiggles.com.au/" title="The Wiggles" target="_blank">The Wiggles</a>, but those of you who are either Australian or have any connection with an extremely young family member will probably have a fair idea. In short, they&#8217;re a collection of dudes who do performances for kiddies, and have managed to make themselves a fortune putting smiles on the dials of kids all over the world. Hats off to them!</p>

<p>The question I&#8217;m asking isn&#8217;t serious ;) But I have to ask it because I think that one of their famous songs has been written with my current software development project in mind! The song I&#8217;m referring to is called Hot Potato. For a fab rendition, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/FV6nJxg7mM0" title="YouTube Video: The Wiggles" target="_blank">this YooooooouTube vid</a>. Feel free to play it a few times and get used to the dance moves :)</p>

<p>So, why do I think that these guys might have based the song on software dev? Well I think it&#8217;s very simple:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Hot potato</strong>: This refers to the job or task that noone wants to get done. It&#8217;s the feature that the client <em>really</em> wants that noone&#8217;s prepared to put the time into implementing. It could also mean a subsection of the system that was originally written to adhere to the &#8220;cold spaghetti&#8221; architecture, which has resulted in code that&#8217;s so hard to maintain the nobody wants to touch it.</li><li><strong>Cold Spaghetti</strong>: AKA &#8220;code spaghetti&#8221;. This is the overall architecture of the software system. It indicates the level of thought that was put into it, and gives a great visualisation of what the resulting code looks like. The beauty of the word &#8220;cold&#8221; in this scenario is that it adds a new dimension to the well known &#8220;spaghetti code&#8221; theory. As we all know, cold spaghetti <em>sticks together</em> in one nasty congealed clump of starchy mess, and dissecting it is a nightmare! Soooooo true in the case of spaghetti code.</li><li><strong>Mash Banana</strong>: Currently very regular in the project I&#8217;m working on! This is all those fabulous ideas that could possibly <em>improve</em> the quality of the system - but team members don&#8217;t like the tall poppies so those ideas are mashed to a pulp so that they never see the light of day and hence don&#8217;t make the rest of the team feel insecure due to them not thinking of the idea themselves.</li></ul>


<p>See, it all makes sense!</p>

<p>&#8230; or am I barking mad?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steam" target="_blank">Steam</a> first hit the marketplace lots of people thought it wasn&#8217;t going to take off - and the bigger companies didn&#8217;t <em>want</em> it to. Over time it really gathered momentum. The bugs were being ironed out, the process was working well, and the subscriber count was going through the roof. As more time went by, some smaller indies signed up to use Steam to deliver their games - giving the small player a chance to get a great deal of exposure to their game at a pretty small cost and at the same time allowing it to be delivered onto desktops <strong>on demand</strong>. Awesome stuff!</p>

<p>So as expected, the bigger players are wanting a piece of the action now that the theory has been proven. EA are the latest contenders in this market, and they&#8217;ve recently attempted to release their competing product - <em>EA Link</em>.</p>

<p>The release didn&#8217;t actually go according to plan. In fact, according to
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35555" title="EA tries to clone Steam, but fails miserably" target="_blank">The Inq</a>, it is:<blockquote>&#8230; so buggy that it just doesn&#8217;t work, and the EULAs are scary.</blockquote> Nice! Not just that, but it also has some nasty side-effects with regards to privacy:<blockquote>I read the second EULA they presented, and this one is much darker and less user friendly than the last. I got about a third into it before I decided that the terms were unacceptable, basically they could use my personal info and share it around.</blockquote></p>

<p>It looks like the only similarity that EA&#8217;s first iteration can draw to Valve&#8217;s baby is that there is some sort of stinky vapour rising from it - which technically is a form of steam.</p>

<p>So, feel free to use EA Link if you&#8217;re happy to have your innards shared with EA. If not, stick to something that&#8217;s tried, tested and proven: <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" title="Steam" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p><small>Disclaimer: I don&#8217;t work for Valve, or anyone else mentioned in this post. The comments reflect my personal opinion only.</small></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know for sure that many of the geeks out there on the World Wide Wibbly have the &#8220;fun&#8221; task of sorting out every possible computer issue for any/all of their family and friends in the cases where they&#8217;re not geeks themselves. I am one such geek, and I&#8217;ll be honest and say that I do not mind helping out. It&#8217;s actually a bit of fun! I starting pondering thoughts on this topic when I stumbled across Roy&#8217;s <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/posts/MomPC-_2D00_-Creating-a-parent-safe-PC.aspx" title="ISerializable - Roy Osherove's Blog : MomPC - Creating a parent safe PC" target="_blank">MomPC</a> blog post a week or two ago. I read the post with interest and think that it&#8217;s quite a handy little reference for those people looking to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>By the same token, I think there are some gaps in what was said. I also think that there&#8217;s a fundamental flaw in the assumption that Windows XP has to be used as the operating system. I&#8217;ll get onto that point a bit more in a moment, but for now I&#8217;d like to comment on a few other options that Roy hasn&#8217;t covered.</p>

<p><strong><u>Firewall</u></strong></p>

<p>The main reasons for having a software firewall on Windows is to prevent nasty trojans from getting <em>out</em> to do their thing, and to prevent other trojans and script kiddies (<em>skiddies</em>) from getting <em>in</em>. Windows Defender is indeed one option, but it&#8217;s not the only one. <a href="http://www.webmasterfree.com/tpfw.html" title="Tiny Firewall" target="_blank">Tiny Firewall</a> is a nice option (though it looks like it might not be supported any more!) which is free for home use, and there&#8217;s always <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/company/products/znalm/freeDownload.jsp?dc=12bms&ctry=GB&lang=en" title="Zone Labs ZoneAlarm" target="_blank">ZoneAlarm</a> which is also free for home use. These two do a good enough job as well. The latter has improved somewhat now that it no longer &#8220;phones home&#8221; while protecting you :)</p>

<p><strong><u>Antivirus</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a huge advocate of AVG, so I don&#8217;t agree with Roy on this point. Instead I have found that both the 32 and 64-bit versions of <a href="http://www.avast.com/" title="Avast" target="_blank">Avast</a> do a <em>very</em> good job of keeping the baddies at bay. I&#8217;ve been using this for well over a year now at home, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. People&#8217;s experiences do vary though, so take my comments with a grain of salt. If you&#8217;re looking for a freebie that&#8217;s good, then Avast is a winner.</p>

<p><strong><u>Email</u></strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d strongly recommend the use of <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/" title="Mozilla Thunderbird" target="_blank">Thunderbird</a> for all email-based stuff. This removes the need for having Outlook and/or Outlook Express installed at all. It&#8217;s got a built-in news reader and RSS feed reader, and is basically a fabulous comms application - better yet it&#8217;s a freebie!</p>

<p><strong><u>Office Applications</u></strong></p>

<p>For most home users, I personally feel that buying a licenced copy of Microsoft Office is overkill. People write a letter here and there, they might open a few word docs that are downloaded off the web, or want to open up some crappy powerpoint presentation with the latest &#8220;fluffy bunnies in tu-tus wishing you wealth, happiness and friendship for the rest of your days&#8221; accompanied with some cheezy music and awful text animations.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" title="OpenOffice" target="_blank">OpenOffice</a> is more than sufficient for these purposes. Again, it&#8217;s free software, it has fairly regular releases (given that it&#8217;s a rather large application) and it&#8217;s cross-platform too. I can&#8217;t see the need to go for another office application which costs a fortune when 9 time out of 10 this will suffice.</p>

<p>Of course, there are cases where people need more than just a standard word processor. OpenOffice has its quirks and pitfalls, and if you&#8217;re looking to go for a package with a lot of functionality then MS Office might just be on the cards for you.</p>

<p><strong><u>Browser</u></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/" title="FireFox" target="_blank">FireFox</a>. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Key Point - What Operating System?</u></strong></p>

<p>As I stated at the start of this post, I&#8217;m not really sure why Windows XP has to be the default installation for a family PC. The big thing that most people will focus on here is usability, followed closely by the range of software and support for things such as scanners, digital cameras and MP3 players - which you can&#8217;t argue with to a point.</p>

<p>In Roy&#8217;s case, I think Windows XP is unnecessary. I think a default installation of Ubuntu with all the required software set up would be more than enough for the default family PC. It&#8217;d be a lot easier to secure, wouldn&#8217;t require constant maintenance and reinstalling every few months like Windows does, and doesn&#8217;t cost a bean. Ubuntu with FireFox, Thunderbird, OpenOffice and perhaps a few games (Solitaire, Mahjongg, etc) would keep the average non-geek family member amused for hours, and would probably cover most, if not all, of the things that the users want to do. The set up of a software firewall wouldn&#8217;t be so much of an issue since there&#8217;s very little (to no) malware that runs on Linux, hence it&#8217;s probably not needed. You don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to run antivirus software (though I still think you should) on Linux as 99.99999% of viruses are targetted at the Windows platform. Finally, auto-updates are on by default which means the OS keeps itself up to date just like the Auto-update feature of Windows.</p>

<p>Bring on Ubuntu installs for the family I say! There&#8217;s no need to give yourself the extra workload of maintaining a family Windows machine when it doesn&#8217;t have to have Windows running on it. Do yourself, and your family a favour - get yourself a Linus distro, and just see how much longer it lasts before you have to blast it away and reinstall from scratch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a regular reader of <a href="http://www.thedailywtf.com/" title="The Daily WTF" target="_blank">The Daily WTF</a> and most of the time I get a good laugh and think to myself &#8220;Boy, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not working on <em>that</em> system.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I get to work and find myself looking at very similar instances of WTFness in the applications I am working on. I think that the level of WTFness in the industry at the moment is sufficiently high enough to make it difficult for a Daily WTF site to cover all the cases. So, while remaining an avid fan and subscriber of the site, I&#8217;ve decided to start posting my own WTFs that I&#8217;ve seen along the way, with obfuscation and code changes to protect the &#8230;er&#8230; guilty. This may become a fairly regular posting category for me.</p>

<p>What I will say before posting my first example is that there might be some cases where the WTFness isn&#8217;t immediately obvious, or the point of the WTF is so small it might be considered &#8220;nit-picking&#8221;. All I can say to that is: if I think it&#8217;s a WTF I&#8217;m going to post it :) Feel free to comment if you feel like it.</p>

<p>So, today I&#8217;m going to start with a couple of files that I&#8217;ve stumbled across which contain an <strong>insane</strong> amount of code. Bear in mind that this system contains a <em>lot</em> of files - there are a lot more files that fit into this category.</p>

<p><img id="image111" src="/uploads/2006/11/wtf.png" alt="File Size WTF" class="InlineImageBlock" /></p>

<p>Yup, that&#8217;s just <strong>3</strong> files. One of them is the code-behind for a web user control (ascx.cs) which contains a 1.5k line Page_PreRender() function.</p>

<p>WTFness: 8 / 10.</p>

<hr />


<p>Edit: I just thought I&#8217;d let you know that these code files are <strong>not</strong> generated. They&#8217;ve all been hand-coded!</p>
