  <div class="entry-content"><p>As it tends to be with many things in life, I just didn&#8217;t <em>see</em> the need for multiple monitors until I had the experience myself. Up until my time at the game dev studio in the U.K. (which will remain anonymous :)), I had no idea what it was like to work on a machine that had more than one monitor. Within a week, there was no going back!</p>

<p>Those of you who use at least two monitors for day to day work will know what I&#8217;m going to say in this post - those of you who don&#8217;t (and in particular, never <em>have</em> done) should listen and listen good! Because the joy <strong>and</strong> productivity increases are just awesome.</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/2006/12/cimg2375.JPG" title="My Current Setup" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2006/12/cimg2375.thumbnail.JPG" alt="My Current Setup" class="InlineImageRight" /></a>Here&#8217;s a shot of my current desktop - including the newly purchased <a href="http://www.samsung.com/Products/Monitor/LCD_Digital/LS20BRDBSQXAA.asp" target="_blank" title="Samsung 204B">Samsung 204B LCD monitor</a> which is this years Christmas present to me from Amy, aren&#8217;t I lucky!</p>

<p>One of the good things about this is that it&#8217;s forced me to clean my desk up, but that&#8217;s only a small win compared to the others ;)</p>

<p>So what is it about having more than one monitor that makes working a joy? The first thing for me is screen real-estate. Now some of you guys who have one extremely large monitor as opposed to two smaller ones will be saying &#8220;we get that too&#8221;, and yes you do, the stuff that you <em>don&#8217;t</em> get I&#8217;ll be talking about in a minute :D When you&#8217;re developing any form of application being able to see lots of information on screen at once makes your life a lot easier, particularly when you&#8217;re debugging code. The amount of information you need and have available vary depending on the language that you use, but for my example I&#8217;m going to use my language of preference, C++, writing my software of preference, games.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re debugging games, you may (or may not) want to have the following information available:</p>

<ul><li>Call Stack</li><li>Watch Window(s)</li><li>Memory Windows</li><li>Registers</li><li>Source Code</li><li>Machine Code (ASM)</li><li>Solution Explorers</li><li>Breakpoint Listings</li><li>&#8230;etc</li></ul>


<p>You get the point. There&#8217;s a LOT of information you can have on screen at any given time, and being able to see what you need at any given time is great. Try fitting even half of that stuff onto a single monitor! It&#8217;s a tough job. If you have a massive monitor, then it&#8217;s a bit easier, and easier again if it&#8217;s widescreen.</p>

<p>So, that just caters for your dev environment. What about the software itself!? You need to see that running while you&#8217;re debugging - if you&#8217;re writing PC games, you don&#8217;t want to have to debug in windowed mode as it&#8217;s not really a great reflection of how things will run when you&#8217;re running fullscreen - so you should really debug fullscreen. With a single monitor, not possible. With dual, totally possible.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that most other people have lots of other stuff running too - all fighting to get a piece of that hard-core on screen action:</p>

<ul><li>Email</li><li>Web Browser(s)</li><li>Instant Messenger(s)</li><li>File Explorers</li><li>Terminal Windows</li><li>&#8230;etc</li></ul>


<p>Another thing that I consider to be tres bon is the ability to have what appears to be multiple OSes running at the same time but on different monitors. I am, of course, talking about sticking an install of <em><em>choose your operating system</em></em> running inside a Virtual Machine. Fire up your virtual machine, drag it onto the other monitor and maximise - viola! You have two computers running at once (effectively ;)) and they each have their own totally viewable desktop (without the pain of having to switch). It&#8217;s a joy to behold!</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve experienced multi-monitor dev, you&#8217;ll never want to go back to a single monitor. To me it&#8217;s like going back to dial-up when you&#8217;ve had broadband - it&#8217;s just not possible!</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>42??</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been quite some time since I&#8217;ve had a proper rant, and now that the wedding is over and I have a bit more spare time I thought I&#8217;d take the chance to dump some more thoughts about something we all want to know about &#8230; <strong>stuff</strong>!!</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s stuff regards issues around work-life balance and what makes me happy doing what I do for a living. It&#8217;s a bit of a broad topic, but one that I consider to be pretty damned important. I think about this fairly regularly, as lots of people probably do themselves, but I use it as a means to frequently ask myself important questions about life, and what it is I want to do with it.</p>

<p>Regardless of what angle I view this from, it generally revolves my job - after all, this is what consumes most of my time. It&#8217;s amazing how much your work can affect your daily life. In my case, it has quite a profound affect because what I do for a living is also something that I enjoy doing in my spare time (depending on the exact nature of the current job of course). So I&#8217;ll start by talking about my job &#8230;</p>

<p>Most of you know by now that I&#8217;m a geek; a software nerd; a programmer; a developer; a coder; or whatever term it is you want to use. I prefer to say Software Engineer / Developer as it suggests more than just the production of code. My working life is spent in front of a computer screen, which can be very fulfilling and extremely frustrating at the same time. I&#8217;ve been contracting for a few years, and I am currently involved in a development project using C# and ASP.NET. My current work situation is partly responsible for the purpose of this post, as it&#8217;s currently the cause of me asking myself those &#8220;questions&#8221; a heck of a lot more than any of my previous jobs have. Though it wasn&#8217;t originally intended to be so, I am now effectively working on-site as a development contractor for the client that I&#8217;m dealing with, and I&#8217;ve been thrown into a team of individuals who are responsible for the delivery of a certain web-based application. OK, not what was intended to start off with, but hey, I&#8217;m a developer and I&#8217;ll do whatever needs to be done.</p>

<p>During the course of time here I&#8217;ve seen what I believe to be almost every possible fubar and snafu possible in the software development world - and these issues have a profound effect on my productivity (more on this in a moment). The effect on my productivity cascades down to my overall satisfaction that I get out of doing what I do. I personally feel the need to achieve something <em>every day</em>. While this might not be possible 100% of the time, it should be possible 99% of the time, and if it&#8217;s not, then I start to feel like I&#8217;m not meeting my goals and I start feeling a bit disgruntled. When the reason for the effect on my productivity isn&#8217;t due to my own shortcomings, I get even more frustrated.</p>

<p>In short, I&#8217;m saying that when people are stupid or incompetent (resulting in poor work which I then have to maintain, fix or carry), or they have authority which they use to enforce decisions on people that aren&#8217;t thought out, I tend to get narked. I feel that my time at work isn&#8217;t what it should be, and it&#8217;s not how I like to feel.</p>

<p>I like to believe that I have a strong work ethic. I love working hard and feeling like I have managed to produce some form of value or tangible asset. When I can&#8217;t do that, it goes against my grain, and I start to feel that I should look elsewhere to find an opportunity which would let me do what I want to do.</p>

<p>While conducting myself in this manner is extremely important to me, it can be affected a fair bit by the people I work with. In the past I&#8217;ve worked with some unbelievably stupid people, and I&#8217;ve worked with guys that are amazingly smart and driven. Needless to say, I much prefer the latter. Right now, I&#8217;m with the former.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see smart and productive people as a threat, I see them as an opportunity. That is, an opportunity to learn, and an opportunity to produce something even better than what I would have produced by myself. If I find someone who is as good if not better than me during the course of a job or project, then I&#8217;ll do my best to get as much out of them as I can, be supportive to that person to allow them to do their job to their best ability and allow both of us to enjoy what we do.</p>

<p>In the past, there have been two teams I&#8217;ve been part of which allowed this to happen (due to having the right people in the right spots): the game development crew (you know who you are) and the &#8220;initial&#8221; team of contractors working with me in London on an insurance broking application (before we were hamstrung by management). The days were not just fulfilling, but they were good fun, educational and very productive. THAT is what I need out of my job. When I get that, I find myself going home with a smile on my face and a bit more of a zest for life. I don&#8217;t feel let down, and I don&#8217;t feel like I need to spend the rest of the night in front of my compiler trying to make up for the lack of productivity at work.</p>

<p>I also feel the need to deliver. I like to see an application all the way through to its delivery. The feeling I got when I shipped my first game title was one of complete euphoria and satisfaction. It really was amazing. I want to feel that again. I admit it&#8217;s easier to feel that in a game development role because you actually have a shipping date - which generally means closure of some sort. In the standard world of I.T., you do have shipping dates, but the support, updates, new features, etc, kick in straight away, and you don&#8217;t necessarily feel like the application is finished (well, I don&#8217;t :)). Having said that, I have worked on some systems outside of games where major milestones have given me the buzz that I was looking for.</p>

<p>One of my smaller goals in the work area is to know that my software is being used, and that those people who are using it are getting exactly what they are looking for when they use it. In the case of business users, I hope that they are utilising my software / technology to its fullest, and getting a lot of value out of it. I hope that they&#8217;re improving their throughput, coverage, or whatever as they get more and more familiar with it. As a game developer, I like the idea of my software appearing on potentially <em>millions</em> of machines around the world. I like the idea of people of all ages immersing themselves into an exciting world that I helped create. While I was in the U.K I walked past a game shop that had my game (by &#8220;my&#8221; I don&#8217;t literally mean me as a single person, but the game that I contributed to ;)) running on one of the demo stations. A kid was playing it and loving it, and the result was his mum buying him the game so he could play it at home. The happiness on that kids face was priceless, and it made me feel pretty damned good.</p>

<p>All of the above goals are personal and private, but there are others that affect me in a more professional way. I like to be given the chance to work with the latest technology, as it&#8217;s challenging and keeps me up to speed with the industry. I like to be able to &#8220;bank my CV&#8221; while I&#8217;m doing my work so that I can utilise that experience down the track to improve and produce better software for my clients. I&#8217;d like to think that as time goes by, I am always improving as an Engineer, as a Developer and as a professional.</p>

<p>Right, enough about the work stuff, you should have the idea by now. I do expect a fair bit from my job - please note that I haven&#8217;t focussed on the issue of payment. The reason? Payment is an issue regardless of the job you do, who you are, where you live, or what you get up to. There&#8217;s no point in discussing it, as I won&#8217;t really be adding anything that people don&#8217;t already think themselves. I will say this though - I do need to <em>feel valued</em> which is something that&#8217;s achieved through appreciation, and remuneration. There has to be a balance between the two.</p>

<p>So how can all this affect life in general? Well, with cash that&#8217;s easy, life can be hard if you can&#8217;t afford to live. &#8216;nuff said. When it comes to the other stuff, it&#8217;s a bit more complicated. I find that I&#8217;m so passionate about what I do that I can be affected quite a bit by frustration at work. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it doesn&#8217;t make me any less professional, or any less keen, but it can be quite disheartening. I find that in times like this I go home not feeling on top of the world. I feel flat, and worn out, and find that I don&#8217;t want to do much other than relax and unwind. When I get home in this state, I reconsider my options, and try to weigh up the pros and cons of staying where I am.</p>

<p>Of late, I&#8217;ve done this 4 days out of 5 - a pretty alarming ratio! It&#8217;s got to the point where I&#8217;ve even considered changing career paths altogether. Realistically, I won&#8217;t do that ;) I love producing software too much to not have it as part of my life. But the fact that I&#8217;ve even entertained the idea is quite concerning for me.</p>

<p>So, it&#8217;s time now for me to move onto something else. Something challenging, something exciting, something that&#8217;s going to make me feel like I&#8217;m producing. I want to work with smart people who are striving to achieve the same things as me. I want to work with ego-less programmers, I want to find passion and a good work ethic in my colleagues, and I want to feel like I&#8217;m adding value. There&#8217;s a project out there somewhere for me, I just need to go find it. When that happens, everything else will slip into place.</p>

<p>So what is it I want out of life? I&#8217;ve covered the work thing - this time, it&#8217;s personal!</p>

<p>I am a very happy man at home. As you know I recently married my girl of 6 years, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. The next thing I want to nail is buying our own home. This is by no means a small thing! It&#8217;s very daunting to consider taking on loans of around the $1/2 million - especially when it&#8217;s pumped straight into something like property which can be unpredictable. I know almost nothing about the property market, but I know enough to know that I don&#8217;t know enough! That&#8217;s something that I need to sort out. Then I need to know where&#8217;s good and bad, what&#8217;s good and bad, and whether or not now is the time to buy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping that by mid &#8216;07 we&#8217;ll have moved into our own place. I can&#8217;t wait to deck it a house the way I want to without the constraints of being in someone <em>else&#8217;s</em> house (eg. sticking a picture on the wall isn&#8217;t that simple!). I&#8217;m looking forward to being able to stick a hole in the wall if I want to, CAT5 the house if I want to, knock down a wall or build an extension if I want to (and no doubt Amy&#8217;s keen to have a garden so that she can actually put her plants in the ground rather than in pots!).</p>

<p>Finally (and this may scare some of you), I am looking forward to being a Dad. To answer those who have already asked, and to preempt those who haven&#8217;t yet asked, I DO NOT KNOW when that&#8217;s going to happen :) When it happens, I&#8217;ll tell you.</p>

<p>There you have it. Sorry if this rant was a little &#8220;all over the place&#8221;. It doesn&#8217;t really have a comfortable flow, but right now I can&#8217;t be arsed to fix it :)</p>

<p>So what about you? What&#8217;s next for you? What do you currently want or expect out of life?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought I&#8217;d best get in quickly before all the emails start coming in asking &#8221;<em>where are the $*<sup>ING</sup> PHOTOS!??!</em>&#8221; and get a web album up so that you guys can all see evidence of the amazing time that I&#8217;ve had over the last couple of weeks.</p>

I&#8217;ll be posting again in a while and letting you all know about the good, the bad and the ugly with regards to getting our wedding organised.</p>

<p>EDIT: Harrington has <a href="http://paulh.phanfare.com/album/161966/204542" title="OJ's Wedding" target="_blank">uploaded a stack of photos too!</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: Rob the Grey has <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/robertgreyling" title="OJ and Amy's Wedding" target="_blank">joined the frey!</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi all! It&#8217;s been a while since I posted last, but for very good reason. I&#8217;ve been away since the 17th of Nov sorting out various things, packing up and moving south for a short holiday. The reason - I got married!</p>

<p>After over 6 years of being together Amy and I tied the knot on the 24th of Nov &#8216;06. The day was an absolute <strong>corker</strong>, and without sounding cliched, it was <em>the</em> best day of my life to date. So if you&#8217;ve been wondering where I am, there&#8217;s your answer. I&#8217;ll be posting some pictures up soon for you all to see, but in the mean time it&#8217;s back to my holidays. I probably won&#8217;t be back blogging consistently until I get back to the normal daily routine (which includes work :() around the 11th of December. See you all soon!</p>

<hr />


<p>EDIT: I just noticed that Dan the Man has <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/oj-wedding/" title="OJ's Wedding" target="_blank">posted a summary and a few photos</a> of the day. They don&#8217;t include shots of myself or Amy all dressed up, but I&#8217;m presuming that&#8217;s because he&#8217;s waiting for me to do it ;) Head over there and have a squiz!</p>

<p>The thing that annoys me about this is that it was written by the <em>lead/architect</em>! The man who should know the framework like the back of his hand. Scary stuff. It&#8217;s this kind of thing that inspired my comments about &#8220;knowing your tech&#8221; in my post about the day job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sure that everyone knew that this was going to happen at some stage. Whether or not they believed it&#8217;d happen so quickly is another matter. Either way, it&#8217;s official, the new wonderdumpling operating system from Microsoft has been cracked. Aparently the activation and installation of the whole thing has been bypassed, and it&#8217;s available on the web. Check out <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/vista-gold-but-cracked-already/posts/1163266532925.html" title="Vista gold but cracked already - BizTech - Technology - smh.com.au" target="_blank">this SMH article</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Why do they bother? Microsoft&#8217;s software is always going to be a target for hackers and crackers, and I think it&#8217;d be a better use of time and resources if they focussed on improving the user experience and giving the user more control and power when using the OS instead of trying to labotomise the machine if the software is cracked (and hence causing a crapload of problems for <em>legit</em> users) then they&#8217;d find that their users would be happier and they wouldn&#8217;t end up with so much egg on the face!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some overseas boffins have come up with a new way of punching text into a mobile phone, though I&#8217;m not sure I like it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VMoAZNRe1I" title="YouTube - examples with the mobile qwerty layout" target="_blank">This YouTube video</a> shows examples of how they propose to deal with the typing into a phone keypad in a QWERTY-like manner.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t see it catching on, and I really can&#8217;t see companies like Nokia adopting something like this either. I think it&#8217;d be a bit of a mind-job to learn, and not particularly intuitive as it almost requires you to know the QWERTY keyboard layout before you can type. Let&#8217;s face it, the average Joe isn&#8217;t going to be learning the QWERTY layout just so he can type into his phone. It&#8217;s a neat idea, but I think it&#8217;ll become vapour.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see that there are people out there still trying to find new and interesting ways for us to interact with technology, and I&#8217;m still hoping that someone will find something a replacement for this bloody keyboard very soon.<blockquote>&#8220;Computer? Hello, computer?&#8221;
&#8220;Just use the keyboard.&#8221;
&#8220;A keyboard? How quaint!&#8221;</blockquote></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This would have to be close to the dumbest way of verifying the state of a connection :) Well, that might not be true, but it&#8217;s definitely one of the dumbest ways.</p>

<p>This is a funky snippet of code that was extracted from a system I&#8217;m doing some work on at the moment:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">cmd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Dispose</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, if it doesn&#8217;t hurl an exception at you, it&#8217;s valid! Nice work eh? So if you have to check for exceptions anyway, why not just try using the connection in the first place and handle THAT exception instead?</p>
