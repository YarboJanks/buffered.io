  <div class="entry-content"><p>Isn&#8217;t it amazing how life can just hit turbo without prior warning, and your time seems to just disappear!  I need to find some way of sticking blogging back into my routine :)</p>

<p>For the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been playing around a fair bit with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby" target="_blank">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails" target="_blank">Rails</a>.  I&#8217;ve been having a great deal of fun at the same time, and I recommend it to any of you who are thinking of taking up some of your own time with learning web development.  It&#8217;s really good fun, it&#8217;s interesting, and it&#8217;s a great platform for building web apps on.  Sure it has its pitfalls (as do all web development options), but it&#8217;s a worthy contender and it&#8217;s only going to get better.  More on that in another post ;)</p>

<p>The reason I mentioned it is because of the news that ASP.NET has an <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/posts/Big-News-_2D00_-MVC-framework-for-ASP.NET-in-the-works-_2D00_-level-300.aspx">MVC framework in the works</a>, which looks like it&#8217;s going to be very similar to the way Rails works.  I think this is a good thing as it&#8217;ll force people to move away from an (possibly) unnecessary <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/08/DesignPatterns/default.aspx" title="MVP" target="_blank">MVP</a> approach (for most things) and work with a well-structured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller" title="MVC" target="_blank">MVC</a> (which a surprising amount of developers don&#8217;t yet know about!).</p>

<p>No doubt this is another effort by Microsoft to rip off some code from <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/monorail/index.html" title="MonoRail" target="_blank">another established project</a> and claim it as their own, but still if it works and works well, then I&#8217;m not really complaining.</p>

<p>Anyway, what do you guys think? Is this a good or a bad thing?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember when I was in high school as a teenager and all I wanted to &#8216;be&#8217; was a Software Engineer.  I was one of those lucky people who always seemed to know what it is they wanted to do, and for me it was always going to be creating software.  I got stuck into a plethora of coding projects in my own time while finishing school which, along with doing &#8220;Computer Studies&#8221; for the last 3 years, gave me a pretty solid grounding to build on when I got to University.</p>

<p>When I finally started my study of Computer Science at Uni I found many of the subjects very easy - particularly the programming ones.  In fact, they become boring very quickly due to the fact that it felt like I was just learning new syntax.  Syntax is always the easy/boring bit, it&#8217;s the understanding of the programming constructs that&#8217;s the key&#8230; but I digress.</p>

<p>So to keep myself interested, I decided to pick a couple of topics that I&#8217;d always been interested in.  Yes, they&#8217;re very cliched, but the topics I chose were:<ul><li>Software Security &amp; Reverse Engineering</li><li>Computer Graphics &amp; Game Programming</li></ul>Both of these fields had always been fascinating to me, so I decided to take some of the time that I had set aside for study and pump it into these two topics.</p>

<p>An uber-geek was born.</p>

<p>As I progressed through my study I was fortunate enough to land myself a full-time job in a software development company.  I started off working in the testing area, and quickly moved into development.  The application I worked on was an accounting and practice management system, and I was using C++ and VB on a daily basis.  I thought I&#8217;d found utopia!  I was finally in a paid programming job, what else could there possibly be in life?</p>

<p>Unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t utopia.  After a fairly short period of time, I found myself becoming disinterested in what I was doing.  Accountancy wasn&#8217;t interesting, the application wasn&#8217;t interesting, the workplace wasn&#8217;t interesting, there was no life in the developers around me - it was a completely stagnant place to be.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t until that point that I realised that just being a programmer wasn&#8217;t enough.  I had always thought that I&#8217;d be happy writing code of any kind, so long as I was writing code.  But I was completely wrong.  If you don&#8217;t work in a field that you find interesting it becomes extremely hard to remain focussed or even become mildly excited about going to work.  If you don&#8217;t feel excited or interested in what you do, then you&#8217;re bound to end up unhappy.  The bane of full-time work is that it takes up so much of your life that it&#8217;s very hard not to be affected by it.  So if you want to be happy, it&#8217;s a good idea to find work that you like!</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve already mentioned I love working with graphics, gaming, security and reverse engineering (no doubt you&#8217;ve gathered that from some of the recent posts!).  Unfortunately these fields are all very difficult to get involved in professionally and they require a <strong>lot</strong> of ground work.  When I decided to chase one of these two fields professionally, I chose the graphics and gaming option because of the satisfaction of seeing things come alive.  I won&#8217;t go into all the reasons for me being passionate about this line of work as it&#8217;s worthy of it&#8217;s own post.  Suffice is to say that it was appealing enough for me to alter the course of my career to chase it.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s part of the reason I did my stint in the UK.  Getting into the games industry here in Australia proved to be a real bitch.  It is still quite tight, and unless you have contacts in the industry or some experience from elsewhere, your chances of getting a foot in the door are pretty slim.  In the end, the travel, the bad weather, the awful pay cut and the 2 years away from my home land were worth it.  I worked in games with some fantastic people and it was an amazing experience.</p>

<p>Life is too short to be working in a field which you don&#8217;t enjoy.  So if you&#8217;re not happy, do something about it!</p>

<p>And finally we come to the point(s) of the post.  Do you like what you do?  Have you found a job that you find interesting, and is it something that you <em>can</em> get excited about?  Do you struggle to get up in the morning and motivate yourself to charge into the day ahead because you&#8217;re not that keen to get to work?</p>

<p>For those of you who are geeks, what areas of the computer world do you find interesting?  Are you working as an I.T. professional but hate it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.iitac.org/" title="IITAC.org" target="_blank"><img src="http://certification.iitac.org/templates/default/images/HeaderIcon.png" class="InlineImageLeft" alt="IITAC.org" /></a>Yes, you can (most probably) consider this to be a fairly regular segment from this point on :) As I said before I&#8217;ve always been partial to RCE, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get sick of it.  Today&#8217;s installment is another tutorial that I felt shouldn&#8217;t be published.  The reason is because it&#8217;s a tutorial on how to solve an example reversing challenge for the <a href="http://certification.iitac.org/goto.php?target=cat_384&client_id=iitac" title="" target="_blank">IITAC online RCE adacemy</a>, and I generally don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good move to show other people how to do this stuff when they can get certified for it. However, this is just a <em>training</em> example so I think I&#8217;m safe.</p>

<p>The challenge consists of a few tasks:<ol><li>Removing a nag-screen</li><li>Finding a hard-coded serial number</li><li>Finding a valid name/serial combination</li><li>Writing a key generator</li></ol>You&#8217;ll notice from the tutorial that the full source code is included written in 32-bit ASM.  Again, I would appreciate the feedback on the quality from anyone who wishes to give it (that includes you Alister ;) ) as I&#8217;m always looking to improve what I write.</p>

<p>You can grab it from <a href="/uploads/2007/03/01-course-splish-2.zip" title="Course 01 - Splish 2 reversing solution">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While reading The Daily Grind from <a href="http://www.larkware.com/" title="Larkware" target="_blank">Larkware</a> I found myself reading through a couple of articles (<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html" title="Why Can't Programmers.. Program?" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouCantTeachHeightMeasuringProgrammerCompetenceViaFizzBuzz.aspx" title="You Can't Teach Height - Measuring Programmer Competence via FizzBuzz" target="_blank">here</a>) on programmers not being able to program.  This obviously caught my interest as I feel I&#8217;ve worked with my fair share of these &#8220;programmers&#8221; in the past.  It got me thinking about how to determine whether or not someone is good in an interview, how their background affects the way they perform when they start working as a developer, and whether or not having <em>N</em> years of experience actually means <em>N</em> years of experience or simply <em>N</em> lots of 1 years experience. More on this later.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve blogged in the past about what I think makes a <a href="/posts/the-day-job/trackback/" title="The Day Job">good developer</a>, the differences between <a href="/posts/developers-vs-programmers/trackback/" title="Developers vs Programmers">developers and programmers</a>, self-learning of important things such as <a href="/posts/learning-code-security/trackback/" title="Learning Code Security">code security</a>, and I even mentioned a few points while <a href="/posts/are-you-any-good/trackback/" title="Are you any Good?">asking if you were any good</a>.  These posts, along with my recent one about <a href="/posts/writing-object-oriented-code-vs-writing-code-in-an-object-oriented-language/" title="">OO coding</a>, should give you a good idea of my opinion of the vast majority of developers out there at the moment.</p>

<p>If you consider the facts about where people come from, and how they get here, it&#8217;s no wonder that I have such an opinion.  Have a read of <a href="http://tickletux.wordpress.com/posts/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/" title="Using FizzBuzz to find Developers who Grok Coding" target="_blank">this</a> article to see the kinds of problems that computer science students are <strong>unable to solve</strong>.  From the article:<blockquote><p>An example of a Fizz-Buzz question is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.</p></blockquote><p>Most good programmers should be able to write out on paper a program which does this in a under a couple of minutes.  Want to know something scary ? - the majority of comp sci graduates cant. Ive also seen self-proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10-15 minutes to write a solution.</p></blockquote>You have <strong>got</strong> to be kidding me?!</p>

<p>I think this highlights the fact that a lot of people who go through I.T. and Computer Science courses don&#8217;t really understand or appreciate the level of problem solving skills required to make them an asset to a software development company.  It also proves that experience isn&#8217;t necessarily all it&#8217;s cracked up to be (see my final point in this post).</p>

<p>Is programming about the syntax? Pff&#8230; anyone can learn syntax.  Is it about how many languages you know? Pff&#8230; anyone can learn another language.  I think it&#8217;s about being resourceful, being dedicated, being a cognitive thinker, and being a good problem solver.  I would hire someone with no background in software who manages to map out solutions to problems they have never seen before without shitting themselves in the process over someone who&#8217;s got <em>N</em> years experience with <em>X</em> different languages and technologies that just can&#8217;t solve a simple problem by themselves.  Don&#8217;t laugh, those people are out there!  They may even be working alongside you (they could be you! :) .. or me!).</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;d be a bit unfair to list a few examples of people I know fit into this category of programmer, and it&#8217;s not really necessary anyway.  But I will say they&#8217;re <em>everywhere</em>.  So how do you weed them out before giving them a job? Is the idea of &#8220;FizzBuzz&#8221; enough?  Are technical questions and programming problems in interviews the best way of finding out a programmers ability?</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#8217;ve got mixed feelings about this.  I&#8217;ve been in interviews in the past where the questions are so hard that only someone with prior intimate knowledge of the problem space would be able to answer properly.  I&#8217;ve had interviews where the questions were incredibly easy, to the point where I&#8217;ve questioned the level of the position I was applying for.  I&#8217;ve had interviews where I&#8217;ve been asked some extremely obscure questions that just don&#8217;t relate to anything!</p>

<p>I can see how one of these types of questions can get different information about the interviewee.</p>

<ul><li>In the first case the interviewer probably doesn&#8217;t expect the candidate to be able to answer the question properly.  Instead they&#8217;re looking at the approach that the candidate is taking to attempt to come up with a solution while monitoring how he/she performs under pressure and deals with the stress of having the interviewer <em>wait</em> for them to produce a solution.</li><li>In the second case the interviewer is looking to see if the candidate responds by saying &#8220;wow, that was surprisingly easy&#8221;.  If they don&#8217;t then chances are you&#8217;ve got someone who is looking for a cushy job, or who is grateful that the problem was so simple!</li><li>In the third case the candidate&#8217;s though processes are being monitored and their actions reviewed while they&#8217;re thrown into a problem space that they couldn&#8217;t possibly fathom as part of their job.</li></ul>


<p>Is there a &#8220;wrong&#8221; question for an interview?  No, I don&#8217;t think so.  I think most questions are appropriate for interviews so long as you get the required information out of the candidate in using them.  If the question isn&#8217;t designed to extract the required type of information then don&#8217;t ask it!  Candidates themselves should be prepared to face a plethora of topics in an interview, and if they can&#8217;t stand the heat then they shouldn&#8217;t be in the kitchen (I think I&#8217;ve said that before).</p>

<p>I think that wannabe developers need to understand that Software Development isn&#8217;t a free ride.  It&#8217;s not a guarantee of a $1mill/year salary.  It&#8217;s not a cushy field to get a job in.  It&#8217;s <em>hard</em> to be recognised and you have work your tits off if you want to get somewhere in the field.  It may do you good to know that &#8230;<ul><li>&#8230; understanding 50% of a programming language and using it to hack a few basic applications together &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; making a database or reporting application using MS Excel or MS Access &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; using VB to &#8220;write&#8221; an application which let&#8217;s you keep track of your own budget &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; writing a few JavaScript widges &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; doing a few assignments at university &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; creating a game trainer/crack &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; scripting a few programs to make your general computing life easier &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; anything like the previous points &#8230;</li></ul>
<strong><em>&#8230; does not make you a developer!</em></strong>  Your aptitude, your problem solving, your resourcefulness and your love of challenges are what aid you in <em>becoming</em> a developer.</p>

<p>Finally I&#8217;d like to just recap a point I made earlier:<blockquote><p>&#8230;whether or not having <em>N</em> years of experience actually means <em>N</em> years of experience or simply <em>N</em> lots of 1 years experience&#8230;</p></blockquote>There are people out there who have worked in the industry for years and for each year they&#8217;ve looked to improve themselves, keep up to date with technologies, languages, best practices, patterns, platforms and <em>insert other buzzword here</em>.  They love their tech, and they work very hard to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t outpace them.  These are the kind of people who have a 1:1 ratio of experience years to work years, and these are the kinds of people that <em>you should hire!</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found a large percentage of the developers that I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of dealing with have a ratio of 1:3 or 1:4 - meaning that they&#8217;ve had that one year of experience three or four times.  There is a <strong>big</strong> difference.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a long time I&#8217;ve been interested in the lovely and exciting art of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse Engineering" target="_blank">Reverse Code Engineering</a> (RCE) and on more than one occasion I&#8217;ve been sucked in to spending hours and hours delving through pages of ASM code searching for the answer.</p>

<p>Today is no different. With Amy feeling pretty crook due to a nasty headache, I thought I&#8217;d retire to my PC and do something quiet that I haven&#8217;t done for ages. So I downloaded a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackme" title="Crackme" target="_blank">crackme</a> from <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/" title="Crackmes.de" target="_blank">Crackmes.de</a> and started reversing. After nailing the problem to the wall, I decided to unleash my learnings on the world via a tutorial. When coders go through the rigmarole of producing these little apps for people like me to play with, it seems only fair that I give back with a bit of information on how I broke their protection scheme. Not just that, but it gives other wannabe-reversers something to read and learn from to.</p>

<p>For those of you who are interested in reading and learning the basics, feel free to <a href="/uploads/2007/03/nts-crackme10-solution-thecolonial.zip" title="Solution to a Crackme">download the goods</a>. Any feedback is appreciated (but only if it&#8217;s good :D ).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of work of late dealing with interops between managed and unmanaged code, and I have nailed a little snippet which shows how convert between a managed .NET String object and a stanard ANSI/C-style string. Check out the following code if you need to do the same:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">managedString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">WHATEVER</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">IntPtr</span> <span class="n">stringPtr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Runtime</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">InteropServices</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Marshal</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">StringToHGlobalAnsi</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">myString</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">unmanagedString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">static_cast</span><span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="kt">char</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">stringPtr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ToPointer</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// do whatever you want with the unmanaged string ...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">CallReallyOldCFunction</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">unManagedString</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Runtime</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">InteropServices</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Marshal</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">FreeHGlobal</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">stringPtr</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another option is to use the CString class, but some people might not want to have to deal with the extra overhead or objects. The choice is yours :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know that the pictures that we find in magazines, posters and movies are edited. A lot. But it&#8217;s hard to really get a good idea of what actually goes on behind the scenes until you see something like <a href="http://blog.futurelab.net/2006/10/this_video_is_important.html" title="Marketing &amp; Strategy Innovation Blog: this video is important">this</a>. Scary eh? Makes you realise that absolutely anyone can be &#8220;model material&#8221; as long as they have a stack of make-up and a friend who&#8217;s good enough with photoshop.</p>

<p>Amazing how this also relates to software isn&#8217;t it!?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This isn&#8217;t a question directed at you guys :) This is a question that lots of people have been asking me of late, and I felt the need to answer the question once and for all.</p>

<ul><li>The short answer is: <strong>No</strong>.</li><li>The medium answer is: I have a licenced copy because I am an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" title="MSDN" target="_blank">MSDN</a> subscriber and I <em>still</em> haven&#8217;t installed it. So what does that tell you?</li><li>The long answer is: If you are looking for an operating system that chews up a lot of resources, behaves like Windows XP with a new coat of paint, doesn&#8217;t play nicely with most of the games on the market, takes away your rights as a user and consumer of most forms of digital content <strong>and</strong> gives you constant issues with your hardware, then <em>yes</em>. If you&#8217;d prefer to have control over your computer instead of giving that control to Microsoft, then I highly recommend avoiding it.</li></ul>


<p>If you don&#8217;t have any issues using Windows XP then I feel you have no reason to upgrade. If you have issues running Windows XP then you&#8217;re going to have a big problem getting Vista to work, and hence you should consider something else (like Linux).</p>

<p>All flames, trolls and whinging repsonses are welcome :)</p>
