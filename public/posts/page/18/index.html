  <div class="entry-content"><p>While reading The Daily Grind from <a href="http://www.larkware.com/" title="Larkware" target="_blank">Larkware</a> I found myself reading through a couple of articles (<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html" title="Why Can't Programmers.. Program?" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouCantTeachHeightMeasuringProgrammerCompetenceViaFizzBuzz.aspx" title="You Can't Teach Height - Measuring Programmer Competence via FizzBuzz" target="_blank">here</a>) on programmers not being able to program.  This obviously caught my interest as I feel I&#8217;ve worked with my fair share of these &#8220;programmers&#8221; in the past.  It got me thinking about how to determine whether or not someone is good in an interview, how their background affects the way they perform when they start working as a developer, and whether or not having <em>N</em> years of experience actually means <em>N</em> years of experience or simply <em>N</em> lots of 1 years experience. More on this later.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve blogged in the past about what I think makes a <a href="/posts/the-day-job/trackback/" title="The Day Job">good developer</a>, the differences between <a href="/posts/developers-vs-programmers/trackback/" title="Developers vs Programmers">developers and programmers</a>, self-learning of important things such as <a href="/posts/learning-code-security/trackback/" title="Learning Code Security">code security</a>, and I even mentioned a few points while <a href="/posts/are-you-any-good/trackback/" title="Are you any Good?">asking if you were any good</a>.  These posts, along with my recent one about <a href="/posts/writing-object-oriented-code-vs-writing-code-in-an-object-oriented-language/" title="">OO coding</a>, should give you a good idea of my opinion of the vast majority of developers out there at the moment.</p>

<p>If you consider the facts about where people come from, and how they get here, it&#8217;s no wonder that I have such an opinion.  Have a read of <a href="http://tickletux.wordpress.com/posts/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/" title="Using FizzBuzz to find Developers who Grok Coding" target="_blank">this</a> article to see the kinds of problems that computer science students are <strong>unable to solve</strong>.  From the article:<blockquote><p>An example of a Fizz-Buzz question is the following:</p><blockquote><p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.</p></blockquote><p>Most good programmers should be able to write out on paper a program which does this in a under a couple of minutes.  Want to know something scary ? - the majority of comp sci graduates cant. Ive also seen self-proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10-15 minutes to write a solution.</p></blockquote>You have <strong>got</strong> to be kidding me?!</p>

<p>I think this highlights the fact that a lot of people who go through I.T. and Computer Science courses don&#8217;t really understand or appreciate the level of problem solving skills required to make them an asset to a software development company.  It also proves that experience isn&#8217;t necessarily all it&#8217;s cracked up to be (see my final point in this post).</p>

<p>Is programming about the syntax? Pff&#8230; anyone can learn syntax.  Is it about how many languages you know? Pff&#8230; anyone can learn another language.  I think it&#8217;s about being resourceful, being dedicated, being a cognitive thinker, and being a good problem solver.  I would hire someone with no background in software who manages to map out solutions to problems they have never seen before without shitting themselves in the process over someone who&#8217;s got <em>N</em> years experience with <em>X</em> different languages and technologies that just can&#8217;t solve a simple problem by themselves.  Don&#8217;t laugh, those people are out there!  They may even be working alongside you (they could be you! :) .. or me!).</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;d be a bit unfair to list a few examples of people I know fit into this category of programmer, and it&#8217;s not really necessary anyway.  But I will say they&#8217;re <em>everywhere</em>.  So how do you weed them out before giving them a job? Is the idea of &#8220;FizzBuzz&#8221; enough?  Are technical questions and programming problems in interviews the best way of finding out a programmers ability?</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#8217;ve got mixed feelings about this.  I&#8217;ve been in interviews in the past where the questions are so hard that only someone with prior intimate knowledge of the problem space would be able to answer properly.  I&#8217;ve had interviews where the questions were incredibly easy, to the point where I&#8217;ve questioned the level of the position I was applying for.  I&#8217;ve had interviews where I&#8217;ve been asked some extremely obscure questions that just don&#8217;t relate to anything!</p>

<p>I can see how one of these types of questions can get different information about the interviewee.</p>

<ul><li>In the first case the interviewer probably doesn&#8217;t expect the candidate to be able to answer the question properly.  Instead they&#8217;re looking at the approach that the candidate is taking to attempt to come up with a solution while monitoring how he/she performs under pressure and deals with the stress of having the interviewer <em>wait</em> for them to produce a solution.</li><li>In the second case the interviewer is looking to see if the candidate responds by saying &#8220;wow, that was surprisingly easy&#8221;.  If they don&#8217;t then chances are you&#8217;ve got someone who is looking for a cushy job, or who is grateful that the problem was so simple!</li><li>In the third case the candidate&#8217;s though processes are being monitored and their actions reviewed while they&#8217;re thrown into a problem space that they couldn&#8217;t possibly fathom as part of their job.</li></ul>


<p>Is there a &#8220;wrong&#8221; question for an interview?  No, I don&#8217;t think so.  I think most questions are appropriate for interviews so long as you get the required information out of the candidate in using them.  If the question isn&#8217;t designed to extract the required type of information then don&#8217;t ask it!  Candidates themselves should be prepared to face a plethora of topics in an interview, and if they can&#8217;t stand the heat then they shouldn&#8217;t be in the kitchen (I think I&#8217;ve said that before).</p>

<p>I think that wannabe developers need to understand that Software Development isn&#8217;t a free ride.  It&#8217;s not a guarantee of a $1mill/year salary.  It&#8217;s not a cushy field to get a job in.  It&#8217;s <em>hard</em> to be recognised and you have work your tits off if you want to get somewhere in the field.  It may do you good to know that &#8230;<ul><li>&#8230; understanding 50% of a programming language and using it to hack a few basic applications together &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; making a database or reporting application using MS Excel or MS Access &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; using VB to &#8220;write&#8221; an application which let&#8217;s you keep track of your own budget &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; writing a few JavaScript widges &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; doing a few assignments at university &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; creating a game trainer/crack &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; scripting a few programs to make your general computing life easier &#8230; or</li><li>&#8230; anything like the previous points &#8230;</li></ul>
<strong><em>&#8230; does not make you a developer!</em></strong>  Your aptitude, your problem solving, your resourcefulness and your love of challenges are what aid you in <em>becoming</em> a developer.</p>

<p>Finally I&#8217;d like to just recap a point I made earlier:<blockquote><p>&#8230;whether or not having <em>N</em> years of experience actually means <em>N</em> years of experience or simply <em>N</em> lots of 1 years experience&#8230;</p></blockquote>There are people out there who have worked in the industry for years and for each year they&#8217;ve looked to improve themselves, keep up to date with technologies, languages, best practices, patterns, platforms and <em>insert other buzzword here</em>.  They love their tech, and they work very hard to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t outpace them.  These are the kind of people who have a 1:1 ratio of experience years to work years, and these are the kinds of people that <em>you should hire!</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found a large percentage of the developers that I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of dealing with have a ratio of 1:3 or 1:4 - meaning that they&#8217;ve had that one year of experience three or four times.  There is a <strong>big</strong> difference.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a long time I&#8217;ve been interested in the lovely and exciting art of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse Engineering" target="_blank">Reverse Code Engineering</a> (RCE) and on more than one occasion I&#8217;ve been sucked in to spending hours and hours delving through pages of ASM code searching for the answer.</p>

<p>Today is no different. With Amy feeling pretty crook due to a nasty headache, I thought I&#8217;d retire to my PC and do something quiet that I haven&#8217;t done for ages. So I downloaded a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackme" title="Crackme" target="_blank">crackme</a> from <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/" title="Crackmes.de" target="_blank">Crackmes.de</a> and started reversing. After nailing the problem to the wall, I decided to unleash my learnings on the world via a tutorial. When coders go through the rigmarole of producing these little apps for people like me to play with, it seems only fair that I give back with a bit of information on how I broke their protection scheme. Not just that, but it gives other wannabe-reversers something to read and learn from to.</p>

<p>For those of you who are interested in reading and learning the basics, feel free to <a href="/uploads/2007/03/nts-crackme10-solution-thecolonial.zip" title="Solution to a Crackme">download the goods</a>. Any feedback is appreciated (but only if it&#8217;s good :D ).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of work of late dealing with interops between managed and unmanaged code, and I have nailed a little snippet which shows how convert between a managed .NET String object and a stanard ANSI/C-style string. Check out the following code if you need to do the same:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">managedString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">WHATEVER</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// do whatever you want with the unmanaged string ...</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">CallReallyOldCFunction</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">unManagedString</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">System</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Runtime</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">InteropServices</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Marshal</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">FreeHGlobal</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">stringPtr</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Another option is to use the CString class, but some people might not want to have to deal with the extra overhead or objects. The choice is yours :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We all know that the pictures that we find in magazines, posters and movies are edited. A lot. But it&#8217;s hard to really get a good idea of what actually goes on behind the scenes until you see something like <a href="http://blog.futurelab.net/2006/10/this_video_is_important.html" title="Marketing &amp; Strategy Innovation Blog: this video is important">this</a>. Scary eh? Makes you realise that absolutely anyone can be &#8220;model material&#8221; as long as they have a stack of make-up and a friend who&#8217;s good enough with photoshop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This isn&#8217;t a question directed at you guys :) This is a question that lots of people have been asking me of late, and I felt the need to answer the question once and for all.</p>

<ul><li>The short answer is: <strong>No</strong>.</li><li>The medium answer is: I have a licenced copy because I am an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" title="MSDN" target="_blank">MSDN</a> subscriber and I <em>still</em> haven&#8217;t installed it. So what does that tell you?</li><li>The long answer is: If you are looking for an operating system that chews up a lot of resources, behaves like Windows XP with a new coat of paint, doesn&#8217;t play nicely with most of the games on the market, takes away your rights as a user and consumer of most forms of digital content <strong>and</strong> gives you constant issues with your hardware, then <em>yes</em>. If you&#8217;d prefer to have control over your computer instead of giving that control to Microsoft, then I highly recommend avoiding it.</li></ul>


<p>If you don&#8217;t have any issues using Windows XP then I feel you have no reason to upgrade. If you have issues running Windows XP then you&#8217;re going to have a big problem getting Vista to work, and hence you should consider something else (like Linux).</p>

<p>All flames, trolls and whinging repsonses are welcome :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love my sport. Without it I&#8217;d go nuts. It&#8217;s a great venting mechanism, it lets you burn off calories and makes you feel good.</p>

<p><a href="/uploads/2007/02/leg.jpg" title="One of my injuries" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2007/02/leg.thumbnail.jpg" alt="One of my injuries" class="InlineImageLeft" /></a>Unfortunately, not every sporting session turns out the way you&#8217;d like it. You might lose a game, or run a bad time, or twist your ankle - you might even get clobbered by someone on the opposite team and end up in quite a bit of pain.  Last night&#8217;s game of indoor soccer proved to be fairly tough :) Not because the game was especially taxing, but more because the team we played against were a bunch of thugs. Luckily for them they were close friends of the Referee, and hence some seriously dubious calls were made in their favour. We were battered constantly without compensation by the Ref, and when we fought back we were penalised. Frustrating to say the least. We finished the game at 4 - 4, and hobbled off the court. The piccy to the left (click on it to zoom) is a shot of my least painful injury - it&#8217;s of the inside of my left leg after I threw myself in front of a guy taking a shot at goal. The ball was new, very shiny and pumped up way too hard.  Ouch.</p>

<p>As a small moral victory, the fact they didn&#8217;t beat us in the second round means that they won&#8217;t get another shot at us. This gives us a season victory over them because we beat them 8 - 1 in the first round. Isn&#8217;t it amazing what you can do when your whole team turns up!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to the next in the series of posts on program shortcuts. This time round we&#8217;re talking Visual Studio. I&#8217;ll be assuming that you don&#8217;t have the <a href="http://www.viemu.com/" title="ViEmu" target="_blank">ViEmu</a> plugin enabled and that you&#8217;re just using the IDE in the way it was intended without any other form of shortcut-based plugin installed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using Visual Studio 2005 and I think I have the C# settings enabled by default. Most of these shortcuts will work regardless of the default setting that you have, but some of them will no doubt be different. Please note that I won&#8217;t be going through every single shortcut that Visual Studio supports, instead I&#8217;ll be going through the ones that I find very handy. If you&#8217;re looking to find a complete list, then you should check out <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" title="MSDN" target="_blank">MSDN</a>.</p>

<p>Basic text manipulation shortcuts are the same as what is posted in the <a href="/posts/shortcuts-windows/trackback/" title="Shortcuts: Windows">Windows shortcuts</a> entry that I posted. OK, on with the goodies.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CTRL + Space or CTRL + K, L</strong> - Display the Intellisense members drop-down based on the current cursor position, or auto-complete the current symbol.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + SHIFT + Space or CTRL + K, P</strong> - Display the Intellisense parameter list tool-tip based on the corrent curosr position (handy for when you&#8217;ve forgotten a function&#8217;s singature).</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + F3</strong> - Find the next instance of the word under the cursor.</li>
<li><strong>F3</strong> - Find the next instance of the search word.</li>
<li><strong>SHIFT + F3</strong> - Find the previous instance of the search word.</li>

<li><strong>CTRL + F</strong> - Open the Quick Find dialog.</li>

</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s far from an exhaustive list, but I think there may well be some in there that you haven&#8217;t seen before. There are a stack more, so check out the documentation if this little list doesn&#8217;t sort you out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first of a collection of posts that I&#8217;m going to be making about shortcuts in applications. I&#8217;m constantly on the lookout for keyboard shortcuts to aid in improving the speed of my day to day activities, and I thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to start sharing them with you. These posts will probably get edited a few times over the course of their lives as I find more shortcuts :)</p>

<p>Below is a list of shortcuts that I use for generally getting around Windows. Note that when I refer to the <em>WIN</em> key I am referring to the Windows/Start key that lies between <em>CTRL</em> and <em>ALT</em> on the keyboard. Most of these shortcuts will work regardless of the application you&#8217;re currently using as these shortcuts are &#8216;unwritten laws&#8217;. Some of these are pretty obvious, but I&#8217;ll stick them in anyway. Some of them might be XP specific, but most of them will work regardless of the Windows version.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>WIN + E</strong> - Open a new Windows File Explorer window.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + R</strong> - Open the &#8216;Run&#8217; dialog.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + F</strong> - Open a new Windows Search/Find window.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + U</strong> - Open the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/accessibility/openutilitymanager.mspx" title="Windows Utility Manager" target="_blank">Utility Manager</a> (most people don&#8217;t even know this exists!).</li>
<li><strong>WIN + M</strong> - Minimise all windows.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + SHIFT + M</strong> - Restore all windows to the state they were in before pressing <em>WIN + M.</em></li>
<li><strong>WIN + D</strong> - Toggles minimise/restore in the same way that <em>WIN + M</em> and <em>WIN + SHIFT + M</em> do.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + Pause/Break</strong> - Open the System Properties dialog.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + L</strong> - Lock the workstation.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + ALT + DEL</strong> - If logged in to your machine as a domain user, this will bring up a user options dialog which allows you to change password, lock workstation, etc. If logged into a home machine that is not part of a domain this will invoke the Windows Task Manager.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + ESC</strong> - Open the Start menu (handy for those without a Windows key).</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + SHIFT + ESC</strong> - Open the Windows Task Manager.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + TAB</strong> - Cycle through applications.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SHIFT + TAB</strong> - Cycle through applications in the other direction.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + TAB</strong> - Cycle through any tabs in the current application (eg. Firefox).</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + SHIFT + TAB</strong> - Cycle through any tabs in the current application in the other direction.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SPACE + N</strong> - Minimise the current window.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SPACE + X</strong> - Maximise the current window.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SPACE + M</strong> - Move the current window.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + F4</strong> - Close the current document/tab.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + F4</strong> - Close the current application.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + C</strong> - Copy the current folder/file/text/image/etc to the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + X</strong> - Cut the current folder/file/text/image/etc to the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + V</strong> - Paste the current folder/file/text/image/etc from the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> - Undo.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> - Redo.</li>
<li><strong>Print Scrn</strong> - Take a screenshot of the entire desktop (including open Windows) and store it on the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + Print Scrn</strong> - Take a screenshot of the current window.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now we&#8217;re past the shortcuts, I&#8217;d also like to show you some of the other commands that I frequently punch into the &#8216;Run&#8217; dialog (<em>WIN + R</em>) to quickly launch to applications instead of using the Start menu.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>services.msc</strong> - Open the Windows Services dialog.</li>
<li><strong>compmgmt.msc</strong> - Open the Computer Management dialog. This is great as it has all the bits that you need to manage your machine, such as IIS, Services, Security, etc.</li>
<li><strong>eventvwr</strong> - Open the Windows Event Log viewer.</li>
<li><strong>iisreset</strong> - Reset IIS (if you have it installed).</li>
<li><strong>cmd</strong> - Open a command prompt.</li>
<li><strong>msconfig</strong> - Open the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/msconfig_usage.mspx" title="System Configuration Utility" target="_blank">System Configuration Utility</a>.</li>
<li><strong>calc</strong> - Open the Windows Calculator.</li>
<li><strong>notepad</strong> - See if you can figure this one out yourself ;).</li>
<li><strong><em>drive:\path\to\folder</em></strong> - Open a Windows File Explorer window at the specified location.</li>
<li><strong>mspaint</strong> - Open MS Paint for quick creation of images files from screen captures.</li>
</ul>


<p>There the ones I can think of at the moment, if I think of some more I&#8217;ll add them. Please give me a shout if you use one that I haven&#8217;t mentioned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I bought something that I know I should have bought a long time ago. In fact, I should have bought it at the same time that I bought my <a href="http://www.hisdigital.com/html/product_ov.php?id=217" title="HIS x1900xtx" target="_blank">video card</a>.  In case you didn&#8217;t know, the stock fan that comes with this video card is by far the noisiest <strong>ever</strong>. It&#8217;s the loudest in their line of video cards, and I think it might even be the loudest across all cards.  I admit that I didn&#8217;t know that it was going to be that noisy when I first bought the card, and I was disappointed to find that it made all my other efforts to make a quiet case pointless :( Without the video card, it was hard to tell if the PC was on! With the card, it sounded like a jet engine waiting to take off.</p>

<p>The solution: <a href="http://www.zalman.co.kr/eng/product/view.asp?idx=192&code=013" title="Zalman VF900-cu" target="_blank">Zalman VF900-cu</a>.</p>

<p>When I installed it last night I was beyond happy. The quiet <a href="http://www.scythe-usa.com/product/cpu/001/index.html" title="Ninja Scythe" target="_blank">HSF</a>, quiet <a href="http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=81800" title="Antec P180" target="_blank">case</a>, and the quiet <a href="http://www.nexustek.nl/120mmcasefan.htm" title="Nexus 120mm case fan" target="_blank">case fans</a> were in blissful silence alongside this masterpiece. My case was silent again! This piece of kit is fantastic. Go get one if you need peace :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know that there&#8217;s a stack of lists like this around the web, but I felt like doing one too! Below is a list of the Firefox extensions that I use quite often for a variety of reasons. Give them a spin if it floats your boat!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/" title="AdBlock Plus" target="_blank">AdBlockPlus</a> - Sick of ads? Even more sick of ads and scripts that manage to get past the default ad blocker? Sick of the Snap.com previews that seem to be ruining the bloggosphere? This is the solution. It&#8217;s absolute magic.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/16/" title="ChatZilla" target="_blank">ChatZilla</a> - I don&#8217;t use IRC that often, but I do use it every now and then to chat to some people real-time about getting over hurdles I&#8217;m facing with my Linux experiments.  I don&#8217;t want to have to install a whole new application to deal with these few cases, and hence this plugin is more than enough for me. It&#8217;s quick, it&#8217;s clean, and it does the job. If you&#8217;re looking for an all-singing and all-dancing IRC application you&#8217;ll have to look elsewhere. But for simple, slick and quick - this is your answer.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/896/" title="CruiseControl Monitor" target="_blank">CruiseControl Monitor</a> - This is more useful for those of you who deal with Continuous Integration scenarios.  This plugin will monitor the CC status of your projects in the same way that the CC.net monitor does.  Very handy plugin if you keep Firefox open all the time.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/271/" title="ColorZilla" target="_blank">ColorZilla</a> - A great web development helper. Allows you to pick colours from anywhere on your site, and gives you the HEX values for the colours you&#8217;re dealing. It sure makes it easy to keep your colours consistent.</li>
<li><a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension" title="de.icio.us extension" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a> - If you use del.icio.us then you have to use this plugin. It adds links to your account at the click of a button.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/26/" title="Download Statusbar" target="_blank">Download Statusbar</a> - This isn&#8217;t really anything more than a bit more visbility for your Firefox downloads, but it&#8217;s a handy extension all the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/" title="FireBug" target="_blank">FireBug</a> - Not enough can be said about this. If you build websites then you&#8217;d be stupid not to install this.</li>
<li><a href="http://fireftp.mozdev.org/" title="FireFTP" target="_blank">FireFTP</a> - An awesom and yet simple FTP application. Who wants to have to fire up a separate FTP app just to send some files to your server? This program is quick and simple, and comes highly recommended. I installed this because I was sick of using command-line FTP all the time :)</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/" title="IE Tab" target="_blank">IE Tab</a> - Every now and then you&#8217;ll come across a poorly implemented web page that doesn&#8217;t support mutliple browsers. Most of the time, these sites are Internet Explorer specific, and that&#8217;s where this plugin comes to the rescue. Instead of having to open up IE separately, you can use this plugin to create a new Firefox tab using the IE engine! Very handy indeedy. Also handy for checking out what your site looks like in IE while you&#8217;re doing web development.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1730/" title="Performancing" target="_blank">Performancing</a> - Soon to be called <a href="http://scribefire.com/" title="ScribeFire" target="_blank">ScribeFire</a>. This plugin is a front-end for blogging sites and makes it easy for your compose your blog posts. It&#8217;s not quite as feature-rich as I&#8217;d like, but is pretty schmick all the same. I&#8217;ll be keeping track of the future revisions of this puppy with interest!</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/138/" title="StumbleUpon" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a> - If you&#8217;ve ever got sick of going through the usual sites, or you&#8217;ve read all your news, or you&#8217;ve even just got some time to kill but don&#8217;t know what sites to check out - this is the plugin for you! At the click of a button you can be whisked away to a corner of the Internet that you never thought existed.  It&#8217;s great to finding bits on the web that you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise find.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/126/" title="TinyURL Creator" target="_blank">TinyURL Creator</a> - Allows you to create TinyURL URLs at the click of a button. Sure, there&#8217;s a bookmark that does this for you, but it&#8217;s not quite as handy as this due to the fact that this plugin allows you to do it with almost any link on the page (not just the one you&#8217;re currently viewing).</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/" title="Web Developer" target="_blank">Web Developer Toolbar</a> - Another must for web developers. Gives you great control over Firefox as a whole while giving you tools to easily modify your sites on the fly so you can tweak things real-time. Well worth installing and a savour for dealing with page layouts.</li>
</ul>


<p>There you have it&#8230; so go knock yourselves out! :D</p>
