  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I bought something that I know I should have bought a long time ago. In fact, I should have bought it at the same time that I bought my <a href="http://www.hisdigital.com/html/product_ov.php?id=217" title="HIS x1900xtx" target="_blank">video card</a>.  In case you didn&#8217;t know, the stock fan that comes with this video card is by far the noisiest <strong>ever</strong>. It&#8217;s the loudest in their line of video cards, and I think it might even be the loudest across all cards.  I admit that I didn&#8217;t know that it was going to be that noisy when I first bought the card, and I was disappointed to find that it made all my other efforts to make a quiet case pointless :( Without the video card, it was hard to tell if the PC was on! With the card, it sounded like a jet engine waiting to take off.</p>

<p>The solution: <a href="http://www.zalman.co.kr/eng/product/view.asp?idx=192&code=013" title="Zalman VF900-cu" target="_blank">Zalman VF900-cu</a>.</p>

<p>When I installed it last night I was beyond happy. The quiet <a href="http://www.scythe-usa.com/product/cpu/001/index.html" title="Ninja Scythe" target="_blank">HSF</a>, quiet <a href="http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=81800" title="Antec P180" target="_blank">case</a>, and the quiet <a href="http://www.nexustek.nl/120mmcasefan.htm" title="Nexus 120mm case fan" target="_blank">case fans</a> were in blissful silence alongside this masterpiece. My case was silent again! This piece of kit is fantastic. Go get one if you need peace :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know that there&#8217;s a stack of lists like this around the web, but I felt like doing one too! Below is a list of the Firefox extensions that I use quite often for a variety of reasons. Give them a spin if it floats your boat!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1865/" title="AdBlock Plus" target="_blank">AdBlockPlus</a> - Sick of ads? Even more sick of ads and scripts that manage to get past the default ad blocker? Sick of the Snap.com previews that seem to be ruining the bloggosphere? This is the solution. It&#8217;s absolute magic.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/16/" title="ChatZilla" target="_blank">ChatZilla</a> - I don&#8217;t use IRC that often, but I do use it every now and then to chat to some people real-time about getting over hurdles I&#8217;m facing with my Linux experiments.  I don&#8217;t want to have to install a whole new application to deal with these few cases, and hence this plugin is more than enough for me. It&#8217;s quick, it&#8217;s clean, and it does the job. If you&#8217;re looking for an all-singing and all-dancing IRC application you&#8217;ll have to look elsewhere. But for simple, slick and quick - this is your answer.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/896/" title="CruiseControl Monitor" target="_blank">CruiseControl Monitor</a> - This is more useful for those of you who deal with Continuous Integration scenarios.  This plugin will monitor the CC status of your projects in the same way that the CC.net monitor does.  Very handy plugin if you keep Firefox open all the time.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/271/" title="ColorZilla" target="_blank">ColorZilla</a> - A great web development helper. Allows you to pick colours from anywhere on your site, and gives you the HEX values for the colours you&#8217;re dealing. It sure makes it easy to keep your colours consistent.</li>
<li><a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension" title="de.icio.us extension" target="_blank">del.icio.us</a> - If you use del.icio.us then you have to use this plugin. It adds links to your account at the click of a button.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/26/" title="Download Statusbar" target="_blank">Download Statusbar</a> - This isn&#8217;t really anything more than a bit more visbility for your Firefox downloads, but it&#8217;s a handy extension all the same.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/" title="FireBug" target="_blank">FireBug</a> - Not enough can be said about this. If you build websites then you&#8217;d be stupid not to install this.</li>
<li><a href="http://fireftp.mozdev.org/" title="FireFTP" target="_blank">FireFTP</a> - An awesom and yet simple FTP application. Who wants to have to fire up a separate FTP app just to send some files to your server? This program is quick and simple, and comes highly recommended. I installed this because I was sick of using command-line FTP all the time :)</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/" title="IE Tab" target="_blank">IE Tab</a> - Every now and then you&#8217;ll come across a poorly implemented web page that doesn&#8217;t support mutliple browsers. Most of the time, these sites are Internet Explorer specific, and that&#8217;s where this plugin comes to the rescue. Instead of having to open up IE separately, you can use this plugin to create a new Firefox tab using the IE engine! Very handy indeedy. Also handy for checking out what your site looks like in IE while you&#8217;re doing web development.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1730/" title="Performancing" target="_blank">Performancing</a> - Soon to be called <a href="http://scribefire.com/" title="ScribeFire" target="_blank">ScribeFire</a>. This plugin is a front-end for blogging sites and makes it easy for your compose your blog posts. It&#8217;s not quite as feature-rich as I&#8217;d like, but is pretty schmick all the same. I&#8217;ll be keeping track of the future revisions of this puppy with interest!</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/138/" title="StumbleUpon" target="_blank">StumbleUpon</a> - If you&#8217;ve ever got sick of going through the usual sites, or you&#8217;ve read all your news, or you&#8217;ve even just got some time to kill but don&#8217;t know what sites to check out - this is the plugin for you! At the click of a button you can be whisked away to a corner of the Internet that you never thought existed.  It&#8217;s great to finding bits on the web that you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise find.</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/126/" title="TinyURL Creator" target="_blank">TinyURL Creator</a> - Allows you to create TinyURL URLs at the click of a button. Sure, there&#8217;s a bookmark that does this for you, but it&#8217;s not quite as handy as this due to the fact that this plugin allows you to do it with almost any link on the page (not just the one you&#8217;re currently viewing).</li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/" title="Web Developer" target="_blank">Web Developer Toolbar</a> - Another must for web developers. Gives you great control over Firefox as a whole while giving you tools to easily modify your sites on the fly so you can tweak things real-time. Well worth installing and a savour for dealing with page layouts.</li>
</ul>


<p>There you have it&#8230; so go knock yourselves out! :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a development to succeed in its use of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration" title="Continuous Integration" target="_blank">continuous integration</a> process there must be a sufficiently hefty deterrent to prevent people from breaking the build. If you break the build, you should feel some form of retribution to aid in stopping you from doing it again.</p>

<p>Plip&#8217;s recently <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/plip/archive/posts/who-broke-the-build.aspx" title="Plip's Weblog : Who broke the build?!" target="_blank">posted a suggestion</a> for this very issue. I think it&#8217;s a fantastic idea! Make sure you print it and stick it up in your office!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t posted a challenge for a while, so I thought I&#8217;d get you all thinking again with another basic little program.  It&#8217;s simple, but there are a stack of possible solutions, so I&#8217;m expecting a bit of variety. So here we go.</p>

<p>Write a program that asks the user for their date of birth using the date format YYYY-MM-DD (eg. 1978-12-05 in my case). The program should respond by telling the user what <em>day of the week</em> they were born on.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re allowed to use any language you want, but you&#8217;re <strong>not</strong> allowed to use the built-in date object functionality other than to determine the current system date. That is, you can&#8217;t date difference functions to determine time that&#8217;s passed. You have to figure that out for yourself.</p>

<p>For those C# coders, don&#8217;t even <em>think</em> about posting: <em>dateOfBirth.Day</em> :) You&#8217;re supposed to do the hard bit yourself</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s easy peasy :)  Don&#8217;t forget about leap years and stuff! I look forward to seeing your answers. I&#8217;ll post up a solution in a week or so. Let me know if I haven&#8217;t been clear.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a very long time since I last ate fast food (such as McDonalds, KFC or Hungry Jacks). In fact, it&#8217;s been <em>years</em>, because I just can&#8217;t stand the stuff and I know it&#8217;s really bad for me.</p>

<p>When it comes to other types of junk I&#8217;m pretty good. The only time I ever eat potato chips is when my mate Mike pops round and brings them with him. I never buy them myself, and they don&#8217;t make it into our shopping cart when we buy groceries.  I never eat doughnuts any more. I don&#8217;t remember the last doughnut that I ate, that&#8217;s how long ago it was.</p>

<p>So, you can probably imagine how happy I was that my junk food habits are very minimal (chocolate being the only contender, and even that doesn&#8217;t make a frequent appearance) when Amy sent a link to me <a href="http://vitalvotes.com/blogs/public_blog/More-Reasons-to-Avoid-Potato-Chips-4439.aspx" title="" target="_blank">describing some stuff that happens during potato chip/doughnut manufacture</a>. In essense, eating this kind of junk food is horrendously bad for you.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s not good for a biodiesel car engine, how can it be good for the human body?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another short snippet this morning. I wanted to inform you of a fairly old-skool story; one that lots of developers will already know about. It&#8217;s a great tale, and still holds a lot of truth for today&#8217;s world of I.T. despite it being very old.</p>

<p>Have a read of the tale - <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/staff/magi/personal/humour/Computer_Audience/The%20Parable%20of%20the%20Two%20Programmers.html" title="The Parable of the Two Programmers" target="_blank">The Parable of the Two Programmers</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Time for another little poll :) This new skin that I&#8217;ve got going has a funky feature which not only randomises the picture at the top of the page, but allows you to have a selection of random pictures that get rotated after a period of time. At the moment, it&#8217;s set to 3 images which rotate after 15 seconds of being visible and take 4 seconds to change between images.</p>

<p>Is this too much? Does it work? Should I keep the transition effect, or shall I just keep it as a single random image each time a page is loaded?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I&#8217;ve added some more pictures now. Only three are loaded for each page to keep bandwidth down, so if you&#8217;re really keen you can refresh ;)</p>

<p>All of the pictures I&#8217;m uploading are of places in Australia :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m going to try and keep this post short, otherwise I&#8217;ll be here all day ranting away ;) This particular topic is one that&#8217;s fairly close to my heart because it&#8217;s a bit of a pet hate for me.</p>

<p>As we (the geeks) know, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" title="Object-Oriented Programming" target="_blank">object-oriented (OO)</a> programming is a different concept to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional Programming" target="_blank">functional</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming" title="Procedural Programming" target="_blank">procedural</a> programming. OO was a bit of a move forward in the direction of easy to understand, more managable and reusable code, and has been adopted all over the shop.</p>

<p>One of the first widely adopted OO languages was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" title="C++" target="_blank">C++</a> probably because of it&#8217;s close relationship and similar syntax to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" title="C" target="_blank">C</a>. Unfortunately, this resulted in something that continues to be a huge bane for true OO programmers all over the planet: <strong>the OOPP (object-oriented procedural programmer)</strong>.</p>

<p>OK, so that&#8217;s a term that I like to use when talking to this kind of programmer :) But the idea behind them is this: when they made the switch to C++ from C, they didn&#8217;t adopt a true OO approach to software development - all they really did was switch compilers.  There are so many people still to this day writing software using OO languages without actually writing good/proper OO code. The benefits of OO are lost on these kinds of people, and the resulting code is just a nightmare.</p>

<p>Before my current job, I worked in a couple of places where there were a few stagnant coders writing C++ - but in fact it was just C being compiled with a C++ compiler. Coupling was through the roof. Encapsulation was non-existant. Even funky features such as polymorphism were avoided to be replaced instead by huge &#8216;switch&#8217; statements which did similar things based on the &#8216;type&#8217; of a structure. Absolutely awful.</p>

<p>At the end of last year I worked with a lady who was by far the worst culprit for this. She was an advocate for &#8220;copy and paste coding&#8221;, structureless code and job security. She was appalling. How she&#8217;s managed to gain contracts for the last 13 years as a developer I will never know. It&#8217;s people like her that end up producing systems that are so unmaintainable, badly written and poorly executed that lots of people lose faith in software. She even managed to this in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp" title="C-Sharp" target="_blank">C#</a>!</p>

<p>When are people going to learn that writing procedural code doesn&#8217;t make them an OO programmer? Using an OO language isn&#8217;t enough, you need to write code in an OO manner.</p>

<p>Before I make my final point I want to make it clear that I have nothing against C, or procedural programming. They both have their place. What I feel doesn&#8217;t have a place is a programmer who refuses to write OO code when that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re hired for.</p>

<p>So, to finish up, what I want to say is this: just because you&#8217;ve written procedural code in the past and it&#8217;s always worked for you, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you can continue to do it in an OO language when you&#8217;re paid to write proper OO software. If you can&#8217;t keep up with technology, proper methodology, and best practice, then perhaps it&#8217;s time to retire?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve used this saying a fair few times in my life, and today I was shown something that I think backs the statement up nicely. This is an example of an amazing Workman with a poor tool - and look at what he creates:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve had the joy of dealing with many recruitment agents as I&#8217;ve been looking for a new contract.  I won&#8217;t get into the choice of job at this stage, as that&#8217;s a whole new blog post right there.  What I wanted to show was my frustration at quality of most of the job advertisements I see on the Internet.</p>

<p>To sum up:<ul><li>They generally have a lot of spelling and grammatical errors.</li><li>They highlight the lack of technical knowledge that the recruitment agent actually has.</li><li>They contain a badly formatted list of &#8220;skills&#8221;, which generally aren&#8217;t skills at all.</li><li>They almost always have no indication of the salary/rate.</li></ul>On top of this, you also get the posts that:<ul><li>List the details of a permanent job in an attempt to get contractors to apply for them.</li><li>List the details of a job in a completely different location to the one that you want in the hope that when you apply they can convince you to relocate.</li></ul>IMHO, this kind of behaviour is taking the piss. It&#8217;s no wonder that recruitment agents have such a bad reputation.</p>

<p>As a final note, I recommend having a read of <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrwizard/web/job.html" title="v" target="_blank">this</a> marvellous article - those of you who have dealt with recruiters will no doubt enjoy it.</p>
