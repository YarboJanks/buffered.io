<!--more-->


<p>I decided to work my way through these problems using <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell">Haskell</a>, as I felt it'd be a great way to learn the language (or at least start to get familiar with it).</p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=1" title="Problem #1">Problem #1</a> in the series is a nice "starter" question. It's a simple one to get you going, which for me was great since I am a bit of a Haskell beginner:</p>

<blockquote><p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>

<p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is my Haskell source that generates the required answer:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">sum</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">999</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">mod</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="n">mod</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Don't you just love how concise the answer is? If you're like me and are new to Haskell, let me explain it a little.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><code>[1..999]</code></strong> - this generates a list of values from 1 to 999 inclusive.</li>
<li><strong><code>[ value | item &amp;lt;- source list, condition ]</code></strong> - this is the basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension" title="List Comprehension">list comprehension</a> syntax in Haskell (basically this is how you generate lists from other lists). Here is the breakdown.

<ol>
<li><em>source list</em> is a reference to a list which is used as the source to generate the new list.</li>
<li><em>item</em> is the variable that is an alias for each item in the source list. This is usually referenced in the <em>value</em> expression.</li>
<li><em>condition</em> is a boolean condition that indicates whether or not a value should be included in the list.</li>
<li><em>value</em> is the final expression that gets evaluated and stored in the list. The expression is only evaluated and added to the list <em>if the condition is true</em></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><code>mod n 3</code></strong> - this evaluates "n modulo 3", and hence gives the remainder when <em>n</em> is divided by 3.</li>
<li><strong><code>((mod n 3) == 0) || ((mod n 5) == 0)</code></strong> - this is a condition that evaluates to true if n is evenly divisible by 3 or 5.</li>
<li><strong><code>[ n | n &amp;lt;- [1..999], ((mod n 3) == 0) || ((mod n 5) == 0) ]</code></strong> - for each item <em>n</em> in the list of numbers 1 through 999, if the number is evenly divisible by 3 or 5, then include it in the list.</li>
<li><strong><code>sum</code></strong> - this function simply produces the sum of all the numbers in the given list.</li>
</ol>


<p>Pretty simple really isn't it :) Enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=2">Problem #2</a> in the series is a little step up from the previous question, and involves a little more thought:<blockquote><p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>

<p>As we can see it's a little more complicated than the previous question, but isn't too difficult either. I won't go into the same level of detail as I did before when explaining the solution as I think most of it is obvious. Instead I'll just explain the bits that are a little convoluted:<ol><li><strong>tail</strong> - returns the list with the first item (the <em>head</em>) removed.</li><li><strong>zipWith</strong> - this is a built-in function that is part of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/hoodoc.cgi?module=Prelude&mode=module" title="Prelude">Prelude</a>. It takes two lists (the last two parameters) and iterates through each at the same time. For each pair of items (one from each list) it applies the given function.</li><li><strong>zipWith (+) (tail fibs) fibs</strong> - create another list which is made up of the sum of each item in fibs with each item in the tail of fibs.</li><li><strong>takeWhile</strong> - takes from the head of the list until the value meets a given condition.</li><li><strong>print</strong> - displays a value on the screen.</li><li><strong>$</strong> - this is used as a way of separating function calls. Haskell is aggressive with its argument passing, and hence lots of parenthesis need to be used to make sure it's obvious what things are associated with each other. the <em>$</em> operator is just another way of doing the same thing without using parenthesis.</li></ol>
Again it's a neat solution. Nice and concise. The kicker here is the definition of <em>fibs</em>, the infinite recursive array. In Haskell, you can define a function using references to itself. Lists are just the same, as they're not evaluated until run-time. So you can define a list with no bounds, and at run-time you have the responsibility of making sure you don't try and parse the entire structure. This is where the <em>takeWhile</em> function comes in to our solution, we only take values while they're less than 4,000,000. Because we know that the Fibonacci sequence always increases in size, we know that it will eventually end.</p>

<p>I'll leave it to you to get your head around the recursive definition. If you want more clarification, just post a comment. Enjoy :)</p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=3">Problem #3</a> in the series is the first one to bring in prime numbers. Here's the question:<blockquote><p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.</p>

<p>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?</p></blockquote>
For this particular problem I decided to avoid generating prime numbers because that takes ages. I had a feeling that later on down the track I was going to encounter a problem where I would need to generate primes, but for this problem I didn't find it necessary.</p>

<p>Don't ya just love built-in Big Integer support? :)</p>

<p>This obviously works from the bottom up. It starts with a special case with an even number. It keeps dividing by two until it's no longer even. At this point, it begins factorising using odd numbers starting at 3. The loop finishes when the last found factor is bigger than the number that is being factored. This works because as we find the factors, we divide the number by the factor. This keeps reducing the size of the number we're factorising, while increasing the size of the factors.</p>

<p>Pretty simple really isn't it! Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm assuming that nobody is going to call this function that is a multiple of 2!</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The next in the series, <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=4">Problem #4</a>, isn't a particularly difficult one, but it could pose some interesting issues depending on which language you use as well as which method you use. It reads:<blockquote><p>A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91  99.</p>

<p>Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.</p></blockquote>
Thankfully, the built-in features of our chosen language, Haskell, make this problem extremely simple. The obvious way to solve this problem is brute force. So that's exactly what I did with a bit of tweaking. For those following my Euler posts so far who are also new to Haskell, you may find there's some additional syntax and functions here that you haven't seen before.</p>

<p>It is fairly easy to understand so long as you keep the following in mind:</p>

<ol><li><strong>show</strong> - essentially converts a value to a string representation. So in our case, it converts the Integer to a String (or [Char] as it is in fact behind the scenes)</li><li><strong>reverse</strong> - reverses a list. So we take the list of characters from the previous call, and reverse it.</li><li><strong>read</strong> - reads a string of characters, and converts it into another type based on the one specified (in our case "::Integer" says to make the value an Integer)</li><li><strong>maximum</strong> - returns the largest numeric value found in a list.</li></ol>


<p>Yet another neat little solution. Essentially a two-liner! I can't see that happening in an imperative language :)</p>

<p>But what is the trade-off? Since this is the first brute force solution to a problem that might be faster solved by doing something smarter, let's see how long it takes. Here's a profile dump from GHC:</p>

<pre><code>  Fri Mar 21 13:13 2008 Time and Allocation Profiling Report  (Final)

<p>Total time = <strong>8.24 secs</strong>. Not blindingly fast, but pretty darned good considering how long it took to write the solution!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After publishing the performance stats of my <a href="http://buffered.io/posts/project-euler-4/" title="Project Euler #4">previous solution to Project Euler #4</a>, I got thinking about how I might improve things. I didn't want to be overly anal with regards to things such as memory allocations, because it's easy to get stuck in the perpetual loop of attempted optimisations. Instead I wanted to think of a method that wasn't as brute force as the previous one. If you're interested to see what I did, read on (<strong>Note:</strong> This is a spoiler for the problem, just like the last post was).</p>

<p>If that's not clear, then drop me a comment and I'll try and explain further. In a nutshell, using the properties we know of the target result, we can narrow down the set of values that we can use to test.</p>

<p>Proof is in the perf! Check out the stats:</p>

<pre><code>  Sat Mar 22 13:43 2008 Time and Allocation Profiling Report  (Final)

<p>So the total time dropped to <strong>2.26 seconds</strong>. Quite an improvement over the previous implementation (around 4x faster).</p>

<p>Thoughts on further improvements?</p>

    <updated>2008-03-23T15:26:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://buffered.io/posts/project-euler-5</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> This post contains a spoiler for Problem #5 listed at <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" title="Project Euler">Project Euler</a>. Do not read the rest of this post if you're planning to attempt to solve the problem yourself.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=5">Problem #5</a> is a great little problem that requires a little maths knowledge to be able to solve in a reasonable period of time. Let's take a look at the question:<blockquote><p>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.</p>

<p>What is the smallest number that is <u>evenly divisible</u> by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?</p></blockquote>
Brute force? Hrm, I don't think so :) It'd take an ice age. Nope, instead we need to do a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple" title="Least common multiple">research</a> to help come up with a smarter solution.</p>

<p>In short, the best way is to find the lowest common multiple (LCM) for each of the numbers respectively. Thankfully, Haskell comes with a couple of handy functions which make it really easy to iterate over a list and find the LCM of each pair of items:<ol><li><strong>lcm</strong> - finds the LCM of two numbers.</li><li><strong>fold*</strong> - iterates over a list and applies a function to each item pair iteratively using the result on the next item. There are many flavours, but we'll use <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html#v%3Afoldl1" title="foldl1">foldl1</a>.</li></ol>
So here it is, the solution to the problem in all its glory:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">IO</span> <span class="nb">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">print</span> <span class="o">$</span> <span class="n">foldl1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lcm</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Genius isn't it :) We could actually avoid all the numbers from 2 to 10 if we wanted, because we know that multiples of those numbers appear from 11 to 20, so to reduce a bit of time we could do this:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='haskell'><span class='line'><span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">::</span> <span class="kt">IO</span> <span class="nb">()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">print</span> <span class="o">$</span> <span class="n">foldl1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lcm</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>That gives the same result just a tiny bit quicker.</p>

<p>Now it's time for me to embarass myself a little. Before I came to the "neat" little conclusion above, I actually did a fair bit of work hand-coding my own solution. I was trying to be too tricky for my own good, and as a result I paid the price of wasting a lot of time. Having said that, I learned a lot about the language when I wrote this, so it wasn't a <em>complete</em> waste of time. The code below is what happens when you attempt a problem without actually doing any research on it :) Enjoy!

<p>Isn't that just terrific :P Not only is it huge, but it just stinks of "n00b". You can tell that it wasn't written by an experienced Haskeller.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=6">Problem #6</a> was a <em>little</em> bit of a disappointment, but I think that's because the solution was so extremely simple using Haskell. Again, we'll check out the question first:<blockquote><p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385</p>

<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025</p>

<p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.</p>

<p>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p></blockquote>Now there are two main ways of doing this. The first requires knowledge of the properties of each of the two "bits" that we need to determine. If you Google enough, you'll find information which leads you to two different formulae; one which gives you the sum of the squares, the other the square of the sums. These will tell you how to solve each in O(1) time. Combine the two and you'll have a magic formula for solving the problem in a single step.</p>

<p>As for me, after doing the research I found no thrill in writing a function which took an integer and returned an integer that's the result of a basic equation. So instead, I wrote the following:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nf">main</span> <span class="ow">=</span> <span class="n">print</span> <span class="o">$</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sum</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">^</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">sup</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">sup</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lt</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="o">-</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">..</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Nice and concise. Sure it takes longer as the numbers increase, but what the hell! If I need to do it in the real world I'll use the method that I haven't posted :).</p>

<p>I'd ask for thoughts, but for this problem there really aren't too many that can be had! On to the next problem.</p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=7">Problem #7</a> was as boring as batshit (to be quite frank). The only reason I'm posting about it is to keep <a href="http://berkshirehunt.com/" title="Berkshire Hunt">The Head</a> happy ;)</p>

<p>The reason I thought it was boring was because it was just the age-old problem of "how fast can you generate primes":<blockquote><p>
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.</p>

<p>What is the 10001st prime number?</p></blockquote>
A simple search of the web reveals a million different ways of solving this problem -- mostly written by people smarter than me :)</p>

<p>So did I cheat? No I didn't. I wrote the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes" title="Sieve of Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> implementation in Haskell and got the answer in a respectable amount of time. Exciting stuff :|</p>

<p>I browsed around the web a little bit after solving the problem because I was interested to see how others might have solved it using Haskell. Yes, I am aware that there is a <a href="" title="">whole page dedicated to it</a> but that wasn't enough.</p>

<p>After a bit of a search, I stumbled across this little doozy. If you can make heads or tails of it you're a better man than I ;) It's quite a mind job to get your head around how this code works. This is an exercise I leave to the reader.

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=8">Problem #8</a> was thankfully a great deal more interesting than <a href="http://buffered.io/posts/project-euler-7/" title="Project Euler #7">the last problem</a>. It goes as follows..</p>

<blockquote><p>Find the greatest product of five consecutive digits in the 1000-digit number.

<p>The comments are pretty descriptive of what goes on. It turns out that the solution isn't that shabby in the performance stakes either:</p>

<!--more-->


<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=9">Problem #9</a> takes a turn back into the math theory and forces you to think about Pythagorean triplets. It goes as follows:<blockquote><p>
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a  b  c, for which,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>For example, 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
</p></blockquote>
The first solution to this problem that I came up with was just atrocious :) It was long, bloated and extremely messy. But it worked. If you really want to see it then ask me nicely and I'll post it.</p>

<p>For now I'm going to show you my second attempt, which is a little nicer on the eyes.

<p>It's a mini brute-forcer which uses two variables to count up to 400. I chose 400 as the end number because it seemed like a stupid idea to go as far as 500 when brute forcing since the first of the numbers that fit the criteria wouldn't be anywhere near that high. For each combination of numbers I pick what's left over and check to see if it fits the rules of a Pythagorean triplet. In this case there is only one that does (as per the question).</p>

<p>We can see below that the solution isn't particularly fantastic as far as performance goes. It's not terrible, but approaching .2 seconds for a problem like this is starting to get on the sluggish side.</p>

<p>Another way of brute-force solving this is to abuse a bit of math. We know that each Pythagorean triplet is representative of the sides of a triangle. Given that the sides of a triangle scale evenly when the entire triangle is scaled, we can assume that if we were able to find a triplet whose sum is a factor of 1000, then we could use this factor to generate a, b and c. It turns out that the 5th Pythagorean triplet (8, 15, 17) adds up to 40, and since 40 * 25 == 1000, we can simply multiple each of the values by 25 to get (200, 375, 425).</p>

<p>While this is interesting, brute-force methods aren't never really the nicest way of solving a given problem. In the case of Project Euler it's rare to find a problem that doesn't have some form of trickery that can be abused to get the answer in a much more efficient manner. The theory that should be used is that each Pythagorean triplet can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Generating_a_triple">written in the following form</a>:</p>

<pre><code>k [ m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2 ]
</code></pre>

<p>This info can be abused to come up with some code to generate the answer rather quickly. At this point, I become tired of the problem and decided not to implement a version that uses this theory. If you decide to write one, please ping me!</p>

<p><a title="Project Euler #10" href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;id=10">Problem #10</a> takes us back into the realm of the relatively boring - prime numbers (again). The question is as follows:<blockquote><p>The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.</p>

<p>Find the sum of all the primes below two million.</p></blockquote>
Exciting stuff! Since we've already got ourselves a relatively nifty prime number generator from a <a title="Project Euler #7" href="http://buffered.io/posts/project-euler-7/">previous post</a>, we can simply reuse this, along with the sum function that comes in <a title="Prelude" href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Prelude.html">Prelude</a>, to generate the answer.</p>

<p>I don't really have much else to say about this. I won't bother with the performance information because it's not really doing anything too exciting that hasn't already been discussed.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
