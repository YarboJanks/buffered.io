  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t ever heard of <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/meterpreter" title="Native Meterpreter">Meterpreter</a> before, you might want to go and take a look at it before reading this post to help give some context. In short, Meterpreter is an amazing library that is part of the <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/" title="Metasploit Framework">Metasploit Framework</a> and can be used to give you tremendous power and control over target machines during a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test" title="Penetration Testing">penetration test</a>. Anyone and everyone in the security game is most likely familiar with both Metasploit and Meterpreter, at the very least, if not closely intimate with them. The toolset is fantastic, and is <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/" title="Metasploit Framework Source">open source</a>!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently in the very fortunate position of <a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/09/05/weekly-update" title="Weekly Update: Meterpreter Updates, VMWare, the OSX spycam, Retabbing, and more!">working with the crew</a> from <a href="http://www.rapid7.com/" title="Rapid 7">Rapid7</a> to help improve Meterpreter, particularly on the Windows (both 32 and 64 bit). I have a good list of things to work through while I&#8217;m on board including making it easier to build for potential contributors, and to fix some outstanding issues that the R7 crew haven&#8217;t had the bandwidth to fix.  These people are super-smart, and super-nice and I&#8217;m honoured that I&#8217;ve been selected to work alongside them.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to document the process and resolution of a bug that I have helped resolve since joining. I also aim to lift the lid on Meterpreter a little and help expose how some bits of it work. I hope you enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Given my renewed focus on security I&#8217;ve been looking to lock down much of my communications so that I <em>feel</em> more secure online. One of the things that I use quite a lot to connect with people who know WTF they&#8217;re talking about is IRC. <a href="https://freenode.net/" title="Freenode IRC network">#freenode</a> is my network of choice as it has a bunch of interesting places with fairly active communities. <a href="http://www.irssi.org/" title="irssi IRC client">irssi</a> is my current client of choice for a few reasons.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer" title="SASL">SASL</a>, among other things, is one thing that can be enabled to secure your communication on IRC. There&#8217;s quite a bit of information out there already about how to <a href="https://freenode.net/sasl/sasl-irssi.shtml" title="Enabling SASL in irssi on Freenode">enable SASL for irssi on Freenode</a>. These instructions worked out of the box for me on Linux, but not on Mac OSX. After downloading <code>cap_sasl.pl</code> and putting it in <code>~/.irssi/scripts/autorun</code> and installing the required Perl modules I went through the steps to get SASL configured. When I attempted to enable it as per the instructions using the command <code>/sasl set network TheColonial &lt;password&gt; DH-BLOWFISH</code> I had the following error:</p>

<blockquote><p>Can&#8217;t locate object method &#8220;send_raw_now&#8221; via package &#8220;Irssi::Irc::Server&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This took a bit of Googling to nail. It turns out that, for some reason, on Mac OSX <code>irssi</code> actually requires an extra package to be included in the script. So open <code>cap_sasl.pl</code> and look for this (it&#8217;s right at the top):</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use Irssi;
</code></pre>

<p>Immediately below this, add the following:</p>

<pre><code>use Irssi::Irc;
</code></pre>

<p>The script should now run fine and <code>irssi</code> should stop complaining.</p>

<p>This might seem obvious to some, but it wasn&#8217;t to me! From what I can tell other people around the traps have had the same problem so I thought I&#8217;d post this in the hope that it helps others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Forgive the title of the post, it was hard coming up with something succinct that captured the purpose of the post. This was inspired by a recent experience with a client who had this exact problem with one of their production systems.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Never use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms524784(v=vs.90).aspx">Request.QueryString</a> to access parameters in your views, even when you&#8217;re sure your actions have validated them. You may open your application up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS</a> attacks. Always, <em>always</em> use data that is passed to your views via the <code>Model</code> or the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.viewpage.viewdata(v=vs.108).aspx">ViewData</a> dictionary. Under no circumstances should you trust data coming in from the web, that includes query string parameters.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past two years I&#8217;ve been heavily involved with organising two user groups in Brisbane: <a href="http://www.bfpg.org/">BFPG</a> and <a href="http://www.bnosql.com/">BNoSQL</a>. Those of you out there who organise your own user groups no doubt know how much is involved in keeping these things going. My focus has been on building communities around the subject matter and trying to get attendance up. It was a tough gig.</p>

<p>For the most part I think I succeeded in what I set out to achieve. We&#8217;ve seen a steady growth in memberships along with the usual fluctuations in attendance, but on the whole the net effect has been really positive. The development community here in Brisbane is very strong and has a lot of passionate people backing it. I think it&#8217;ll continue to grow and flourish.</p>

<p>During my time as an organiser I&#8217;ve had an immense amount of fun, learned a bucketload, met some amazing people and formed some great friendships. But I&#8217;ve got to a point where I think there&#8217;s nothing more I can give to the groups as an organiser.</p>

<p>For groups to remain successful they need many things; the key one being <em>change</em>.</p>

<p>Organisers need to change. Focus needs to change. Ideas need to change. The group needs to get a fresh face periodically to stop it from stagnating. I feel that the time has come for me to step down as organiser and get other people to step up and make their mark, take the groups past where I can take them.</p>

<p>I also have personal reasons for making this decision and most of them revolve around the lack of time. I won&#8217;t bore you with all the details, but for my own sanity I need a break from it. I need to step down before I burn out and lose the desire to attend in any capacity. I&#8217;ve given it all I&#8217;ve got and I hope that in some way I&#8217;ve had a positive impact on the lives of the many techies that I know and respect here in sunny Brisbane.</p>

<p>As of the end of this year I will no longer be a user group organiser in Brisbane. At this point I have no plans to get back involved down the track, but I won&#8217;t say &#8220;never&#8221; either. I&#8217;ll be investing time in building up my own business, spending more time with the family and generally enjoying the lack of stress put on myself twice a month.</p>

<p>I want to thank this technical community for its support. It&#8217;s been an absolute joy seeing people get together at the events that I&#8217;ve helped create and I look forward to being part of the crowd from here on in.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Life is way too short to be working on boring, uninteresting or meaningless stuff. Get out there and do what you love. Screw working for the dollar on something that you don&#8217;t enjoy. Don&#8217;t study in a field that doesn&#8217;t inspire you just because you got the marks or because people expect you to.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://webmachine.basho.com/" title="Webmachine">Webmachine</a> is currently my favourite tool for building websites. I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to use it on a few things now, some commercially some personally. While working on my <a href="http://buffered.io/series/web-development-with-erlang/" title="Web development with Erlang">Erlang web development series</a> I had to handle the case where URLs redirected to other URLs. I found some basic documentation on this but wasn&#8217;t able to find a canonical example of how to do it.</p>

<p>After a big of digging through blog posts and speaking to people on IRC I figured out how it was done. The goal of this post is to show how it&#8217;s done for 301 (permanent) and 307 (temporary) redirects.</p>
