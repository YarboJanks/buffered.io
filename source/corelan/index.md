title: Corelan Exploit Development Training
---

After the rousing success of last year's training in Sydney, **Peter Van Eeckhoutte** (aka [corelanc0d3r][]) is making a return trip to Australia to deliver both [Corelan Bootcamp][] and [Corelan Advanced][] training courses! This is an incredible opportunity for folks in the southern hemisphere to learn about exploit develpoment on the Windows platform from one of the true masters of the art. Don't miss this opportunity, as it doesn't come very often!

There are a maximum of 30 spots available for each course, so get in quick!

## Corelan Bootcamp - 18th Nov 2015 to 20th Nov 2015

<img src="/images/corelan-bootcamp.png" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;margin-bottom:5px" />
The Corelan **"BOOTCAMP"** is a truly unique opportunity to learn both basic & advanced techniques from an experienced exploit developer, at a conference. During this 3 day long course, students will be able to learn all ins and outs about writing reliable exploits for the Win32 platform.  The trainer will share his "notes from the field" and various tips & tricks to become more effective at writing exploits.

We believe it is important to start the course by explaining the basics of buffer overflows and exploit writing, but this is most certainly not "your average" entry level course. In fact, this is a true bootcamp and one of the finest and most advanced courses you will find on Win32 stack based exploit development.

This hardcore hands-on course will provide students with solid understanding of current Win32 (stack based) exploitation techniques and memory protection bypass techniques.  We make sure the course material is kept updated with current techniques, includes previously undocumented tricks and techniques, and details about research we performed ourselves.  Combined with the way the course is built up, this will turn these 3 days into a truly unique experience.

During all of our courses, we don’t just focus on techniques and mechanics, but we also want to make sure you understand why a given technique is used, why something works and why something doesn’t work.

We believe those are just a few arguments that makes this training stand out between other exploit development training offerings.   Feel free to check our [testimonials][] page if you want to see real, voluntary, unmodified and uncensored reactions by some of our students.

Finally, we offer you post-training support as well.   If you have taken the course and you still have questions afterwards, we will help.

For more details see the official [Corelan Bootcamp][] course details page.

## Corelan Advanced - 23rd Nov 2015 to 25th Nov 2015

<img src="/images/corelan-advanced.png" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;margin-bottom:5px" />
The Corelan **"ADVANCED"** exploit development class is our brand new fast-paced, mind-bending, hands-on course where you will learn advanced exploit development techniques from an experienced exploit developer. During this 3 day long course, students will get the opportunity to learn how to write exploits that bypass modern memory protections for the Win32 platform.  The trainer will share his “notes from the field” and various tips & tricks to become more effective at writing exploits.

This is most certainly not an entry level course. In fact, this is a one of the finest and most advanced courses you will find on Win32 exploit development.  To be sure that all students are on the same page, students may be requested to pass a test/exam prior to taking the course.  

This hardcore, partical, hands-on course will provide students with solid understanding of current Win32 exploitation technique & memory protection bypass techniques.  We make sure the course material is kept updated with current techniques, includes previously undocumented tricks and techniques, and details about research we performed ourselves.  Combined with the way the course is built up, this will turn these 3 days into a truly unique experience.

For more details see the official [Corelan Advanced][] course details page. In order to sign up for the [Corelan Advanced][] course, you must first have completed the [Corelan Bootcamp][]. Exceptions made be taken, but they must first be discussed with Peter. If you wish to attempt the Advanced course without taking the Bootcamp, please email [oj@beyondbinary.io][email] to discuss.

## Should you do both?

The short answer is "no". Peter recommends that you do one or the other, because both of the courses are very intense. After doing the Bootcamp, you'll need a break, as well as a bit more practice, before taking on Advanced. Special consideration may be taken, so if you feel compelled to tackle both, then please email [oj@beyondbinary.io][email] to discuss.

## Location

The event will be held in Sydney's CBD, though the exact location is to be determined. The wonderful folks at Ernst &amp; Young's Sydney office have kindly offered to sponsor this event and provide hosting and catering for all the attendees.

## Price

* [Corelan Bootcamp][] - AUD $2,700 +GST
* [Corelan Advanced][] - AUD $2,900 +GST

Note: Attendees that are not from Australia will not be charged GST.

### Refunds

If Peter is unable to attend, then all fees for the course will be refunded. However, other than this possibility, refunds will not be possible.

## Register

Last year's registration process, involving Paypal and EventBrite, was utterly painful for all involved. As a result, this year we are taking a different approach to registrations.

To register please send email to [oj@beyondbinary.io][email] with the following details:

* Company name
* Full names and email addresses of all people attending
* Name of the course that is being attended
* Email address of invoice recipient
* Indication of whether the fees are to be paid via direct bank deposit or credit card (please don't send actual credit card details)

An invoice will be generated specifically for you, or your business, that can be paid directly.

## Thanks

Thanks to Peter for making another epic trip Down Under, and thanks to _you_ for supporting this event. I look forward to seeing you there!
