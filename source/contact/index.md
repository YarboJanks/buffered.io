There are quite a few ways you can reach me if you'd like to get in touch, here are a couple of options:

* Hit me up on [Twitter][].
* Throw a comment on a blog post on this site.
* Drop me an email, my address is `oj@<this domain>`.
* If it's sensitive you can use my [PGP key][] and send me an email.

If it's casual, I recommend trying [Twitter][] first.
