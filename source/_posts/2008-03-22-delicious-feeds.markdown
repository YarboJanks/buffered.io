I've just played with a few settings in my Feeburner account for the main article feed from this blog. One of the things that I've added is a daily list of links that I've added to <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> which I think are interesting. Most of those links are tech related, but every now and then I throw something in that I find amusing and want to be able to find again.

I added this to the feed in case you guys might find it interesting. Let me know if it's annoying/crap/etc. If it drives you batty, I'll turn it off! :)

Cheers!
