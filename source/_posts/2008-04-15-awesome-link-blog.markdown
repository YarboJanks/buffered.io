title: "Awesome Link Blog"

I thought it was about time that I made you all aware of a site that's worthy of attention. I don't usually like to just send out a link and shut up, but I'll make an exception this time.

There are stacks of link blogs out there, most of which <strong>suck</strong>. I have subscribed to so many in the past, along with stacks of firehose feeds, most of which I have since unsubscribed from.

There is one that has managed to survive. That's because it has a consistently high standard of links, none of which have awful content. Many of the posted links have small summaries associated with them which shows that the poster has actually invested time reading the article to make sure it's of a sufficient standard.

In short, it's a fantastic link blog. It does a great job of filling in the gaps in anyone's tech blog reading. Ladies and Gentlemen, point your browsers at <a href="http://arjansworld.blogspot.com/" title="Arjan's World">Arjan's World</a>. You won't be disappointed.
