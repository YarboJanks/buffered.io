For some reason Google Reader has failed to update and include my latest [Web Development in Erlang][Part3] post. This is rather odd as every other RSS reader I have tested (including the one built-in to MS Outlook) has managed to parse and handle the post just fine. I have attempted to get in touch with the GReader team but I haven't had any luck so far in getting them to respond.

Those of you who are using Google Reader and are interested in this post, please point your browser in [this direction][Part3].

Apologies for the issue.
