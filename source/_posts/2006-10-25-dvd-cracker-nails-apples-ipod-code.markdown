title: "DVD Cracker Nails Apple's iPod Code"
---
You gotta hand it to this guy, he says that he "doesn't like closed systems", which is pretty darned obvious :) The man, Jon Lech Johansen, who years ago cracked the DVD encryption known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scrambling_System" title="Content Scrambling System" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and released (with two other unknowns) the software that could be used to decrypt DVDs (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeCSS" title="DeCSS" target="_blank">DeCSS</a>), has taken his code-breaking career to a new level - he's nailed Apple iPod's <a href="http://www.andrewhargadon.com/blog/?p=36" title="iPod's Ecosystem" target="_blank">ecosystem</a> (or so he claims) by breaking their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay" title="FairPlay" target="_blank">FairPlay DRM software</a>.

I have no reason to find his claims outrageous, since he's quite clearly experienced in this area (he was 15 when he cracked CSS after all), so it looks like Apple have got themselves an issue to deal with. It'll be interesting to see if they take steps to stop him and his new <a href="http://doubletwistventures.com/" title="DoubleTwist" target="_blank">DoubleTwist</a> venture from taking off, or releasing any information/software pertaining to the crack.
