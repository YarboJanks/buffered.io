title: "Reversing DirectX &amp; Blowfish"
---
This tutorial has been on the boil for quite a while.  I got close to nailing the problem late last month, but didn't end up finding the time to finish it until this weekend.  This tutorial is a solution to another Crackme, but this time it's really not for the faint-hearted.  Information on reversing fullscreen <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/" title="DirectX" target="_blank">DirectX (Direct3D)</a> applications and playing around with <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html" title="Blowfish" target="_blank">Blowfish</a> can be found in this tutorial, and it's a bit of a mind-job - it also weighs in at nearly 40 pages (with some nice pictures thrown in)!

The crackme, by Silver, can be found <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/users/silver/silvers_dx_crackme_1/" title="Silver's DirectX Crackme" target="_blank">here</a>, and the solution can be found <a href="/uploads/2007/04/silver-directx-solution-thecolonial.zip" title="Solution to Silvers Crackme">here</a> on my site (or on <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/users/silver/silvers_dx_crackme_1/" title="Silver's DirectX Crackme" target="_blank">Crackmes.de</a> when approved).

I'd love to hear your thoughts :)
