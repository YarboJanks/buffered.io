title: "New Theme - What do you think?"
---
I was getting bored with the existing theme, so I decided to have a look at some others.  I actually don't mind this one, but the missus thinks it's terrible :)

In case you didn't notice, it's called "Rockin' Suckerfish". I'll be changing the picture at the top when I can be arsed ;)

Thoughts? Come on Dan, you know you want to :)
