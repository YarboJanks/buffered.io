I just wanted to crank out a quick post to point any fellow <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="Wordpress">Wordpress</a> at a really nice plugin. If you don't use it, or don't have any interest in it, then don't bother with the rest of this post :)

This morning while looking for a "comment approval" plugin for another site I'm setting up with some fellow techies (more to come on that later), I stumbled across a fantastic skin plugin for the administration site that comes with every Wordpress install. It's called <a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-tiger-administration/" title="Tiger Administration">Tiger Administration</a>, and it's an absolute breath of fresh air.

This plugin makes the admin panel much nicer to look at. It's a dream for those of us who are yet to have the balls to play with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/25-sneak-peek/" title="2.5 Beta">Wordpress 2.5 beta</a> on our production sites (FYI: 2.5 comes with a new admin panel), and who have been using wordpress with it's *cough* <em>awful</em> *cough* default admin theme for a long time.

Check it out. The author has done a great job with the plugin, and you won't regret using it. Enjoy!
