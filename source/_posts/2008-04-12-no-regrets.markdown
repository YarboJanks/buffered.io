This is just a brief follow-up to my <a href="/posts/another-new-keyboard/" title="Another New Keyboard">previous post</a> on the keyboard I bought.

I've now had the chance to use it a fair bit, and I thought I'd give you a small summary based on my experience.

<li>It's better than I had hoped.</li>
<li>It is sex on a stick.</li></ul>
Buy one. Now.

That is all.
