title: "Vista Speech Recognition - Maybe try it in Yiddish?"
---
As a final post for today, I just got sent <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1123221217782777472" title="Windows Vista Speech Recognition Demo Gone Awry - Google Video" target="_blank">this classic Google Video</a> from Dan over at Shifty. It's pretty funny!

Having said that, I'm sure that most devs know how tough something like voice recognition can be to build.  Try demoing something like this to the world, it'd be an absolute nightmare! I do feel a bit sorry for this guy, as I'm sure he's not the one responsible for the internal workings of the software.
