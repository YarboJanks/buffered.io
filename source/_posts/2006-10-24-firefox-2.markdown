It's been released :) Our lovable browser has had its second major version <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35284" title="Don't wait for Firefox Numero Duo" target="_blank">released into the wild</a>, which is great news. I've been using the latest released candidate for a while, and have had no issues at all, but now it's officially out there for all to enjoy.

Point your currently insecure/outdated browsers over <a href="http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0/" title="Mozilla Releases" target="_blank">here</a> and start your download.
