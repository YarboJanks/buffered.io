title: "Katacast: Shopping Checkout in Erlang"
---
I've recently discovered the joys of <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/" title="CodeKata">CodeKatas</a>. If you're a geek looking for a way to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People" title="The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People">sharpen your saw</a> then I highly recommend taking a look at these and trying a few out. They're great fun and they're a good way of getting your feet wet with new languages (especially if you're tired of <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" title="Project Euler">Project Euler</a>).

I can thank <a href="http://twitter.com/gabriellelana" title="Gabrielle on Twitter">Gabrielle Lana</a> for this discovery, as it was his <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/8206748" title="String Calculator in Erlang">attempt at one of the katas</a> that got me into it. He's also the reason I looked into <a href="http://www.katacasts.com/" title="Katacasts">Katacasts</a>, which are simply screencasted recordings of people attempting to solve Code Katas.
 
This post is about my first Katacast, capturing my attempt at <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_nine_back_.html" title="Checkout">Code Kata #9</a> using <a href="http://erlang.org/" title="Erlang">Erlang</a> and <a href="http://vim.org/" title="VIM">VIM</a> with <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/" title="Ruby Make">Rake</a> as my build system. I've put the video up on <a href="http://vimeo.com/8513414" title="Katacast for Codekata #9 by OJ Reeves">Vimeo</a> for the world to see/share. It's also embedded below for your convenience.
 
Before watching, I'd like to point out a few things about the video, and things that I have learned from the experience:
<ul>
<li>I captured the video on my Linux Mint install. For some reason, capturing quality video in Linux is proving to be a bit of a pain for me. As a result, the video quality isn't that great. This partly due to the compression of the video, and partly due to the software failing to pick up some screen updates.</li>
<li>I tried really hard to add a backing sound-track but all of my efforts failed in one way or another. If I did manage to get one to work it was either WAY too big (ie. > 1GB in size) or the quality was absolutely terrible.</li>
<li>There were points during the process where I had to alt-tab out to a browser to do a bit of research on something that I didn't know (such as an Erlang syntax quirk). This resulted in a few points where I don't appear to be doing anything. In future, I'll remember to hit pause on the recording when this happens.</li>
<li>I captured it in a non-standard resolution. I'm not sure if that's going to make it look bad or not. Feedback here is appreciated. I think in future I'll capture at a 800x600 resolution.</li>
<li>This video is best viewed in full-screen mode.</li>
</ul>
So please excuse the lack of quality in this first Katacast. I'll be sure to improve when I next create one. That being said, on with the show!

As always, feedback/criticism/etc is greatly appreciated. I'd love to hear what you guys do and use to capture and edit your screencasts, particularly in Linux.
