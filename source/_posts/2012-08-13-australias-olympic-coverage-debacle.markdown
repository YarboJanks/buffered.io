I wouldn't say that I am a sporting nut, but I'm not exactly averse to a quality sporting event either. One of the few _big time_ events that I very much look forward to is the Olympic games. It's something that appears on the radar just once every four years and it brings people together in ways that almost nothing else can. I don't remember a time where I've watch the Olympics and not enjoyed myself.

Until this year.

Why? Ultimately it's because of the media coverage of the event here in Australia. When I say "media" I don't just mean [Channel 9][Channel9]'s appalling coverage, I mean to include stories published in the newspapers and shown during news bulletins. I am talking about the "free to air" coverage, not that which you can get on Fox or some other form of paid TV.

Before I dive into what I think was appalling about the coverage, I want to explain what it is about the Olympics that I love and that I think is important.

The Olympic games is a world event which allows people of all races, backgrounds, religions, ethnicities, etc to compete on the same stage in a myriad of interesting sports. It's wonderful! As spectators we can see sports that we never knew existed. We can see people at the height of their careers achieving things that some of us can only dream about achieving. We see people who are masters of their art. We see people who win when they shouldn't win and lose when they shouldn't lose. We can appreciate the amount of effort and committment it takes for the athletes to get to the point where they are able to compete at that level.

 We feel the highs and the lows. We can get emotional about the wins and teary about the losses. We can see and empathise with people's misfortune. We get told about some of the hardships that people have gone through while still managing to become the best. We sit in the comfort of our chairs and get one hell of an experience thrown in our faces.

I also think it's great for children to watch. Kids naturally love this kind of stuff. It's inspiring to them, it's entertaining and it shows them things about life they may not yet have experienced themselves. They get to learn that it's not about winning but how hard you try, and the effor that it takes to get there.

To me it doesn't matter who the winner is. It doesn't matter if they're Australian or not. It doesn't matter if they're a follower of my religion or system of belief, or not. It doesn't matter if they're men or women. It doesn't matter if they're big or small, black or white, or anything. What matters is that I can see what they're doing and appreciate it. I get a sense of warmth when I see someone cry with joy at winning Bronze. I get lifted when I see the last person in the race cross the finish line despite being a _long_ way behind because they **did not give up**. I love seeing the surprise on the faces of some of the winners. I love watching the amazing feats of human athleticism. Some of the stuff I have seen has seriously blown my mind. I can't wait to see it in four years time, even more so because my kids will understand it even more.

The Olympics is a wonderful thing. We should see more of it and the spirit that goes with it.

Now back to the coverage.

### Free-to-air Coverage was Terrible

I'm 100% certain I'm not alone in this feeling. Twitter has been rife with complaints and insults thrown in the direction of Channel 9. To me it didn't feel like they were interested in giving us the best possible coverage, they were instead looking to line their pockets with as much ad revenue as possible.

We didn't watch the Olympics with ads in between the events, we watched ads with Olympic events in between. I didn't keep timings, but I can say that I can count on one hand the number of events which _didn't_ get totally ruined by ad breaks. It's bad enough that the ad breaks were so frequent, they were also incredible long. Ads would repeat in the same break. We'd hear the same tunes, the same sponsors the same crap over and over again. It was mind-numbing.

During the time that the ads _weren't_ on, we spent a great deal of time looking at Cameron and Leila _talking_ about the events. Sorry, but I'm not interested in looking at them, nor am I fussed about what they were saying. Precious time was wasted on these two during the course of the 16 days which could have been better spent **showing more sport**.

I was also rather unimpressed by the quality of the interviews. If you look at the early medal tally, Australia wasn't ".. doing as well as expected." Yeah? Well so f#^king what? We're out there competing, right? No, the media wouldn't let it go. Interviewers immediately hit the competitors with comments about disappointment and how things "just weren't meant to be". Appalling stuff. There are people out there working their guts up trying to be the best they can be, and the idiots on the other end of the microphone dismiss their achievements because they didn't come home with a yellow medal. F&^k that. It's insulting. If it were me I'd have put one of them in his/her place.

A few other (arguably minor) points about the footage:

* Interviews were long, dull and boring.
* Interviews were _repeated_, often more than once.
* Events which didn't include Australian competitors were hardly shown. Instead repeats of events with Austrtalians in them were shown. Again and again.
* There is more to the Olympics than just swimming, yet the first _N_ days of coverage you were lucky to even get news of anything else, let alone footage.
* Karl does _not_ make a good host at all, let alone for something as big as this.

Before I move on to the written coverage I want to talk about two more things.

The Olympics should be accessible to anyone. That's what it's about. It's a world event. With that, anyone will attempt to watch it, including kids of all ages. So which dimwit in the Channel 9 HQ thought that it was not only acceptable but a _good idea_ to jump into ad breaks, without warning, at 8am (not exactly an adult-only hour) and show either a really short news bulletin or an ad for [ACA][]?

For those of you who don't know what ACA is, it's one of those shitty, hyped up shows that's all about the bad shit that seems to go down all over the country.

So one minute we're watching atheletes breaking world records, then the next minute we hear about people dying in car crashes, other people on charges for sex chrimes, or we have footage of teenage kids running around with clothes that barely cover _anything_.

Thanks Channel 9, you total bunch of idiots. My kids were exposed to shit that they really didn't need to see at a time that I think is completely inappropriate. It was almost impossible to preempt this thanks to the speed at which the coverage was transitioned. This wasn't just a once-off eithe. It was constant. As far as I am concerned this is just more evidence to suggest that you really didn't care about the viewer, you just cared about the revenue.

Finally, Channel 9 constantly switched between their main channel and their ugly step-child channel, Gem. While this isn't so bad in principle, they managed to master the art of doing at the most inappropriate time. You know what? I don't give a shit about "Friday Night Football" when the Olympics is on and I dare say that I'm not alone with that thought. Do you really have to switch footage over to some uninteresting local sporting event right at the time when _Australia was about to win Gold in the sailing_?!

Utterly ridiculous. Whoever let that happen deserves a kick right where it hurts. People around the country missed out on seeing it happen live all because, according to Channel 9's schedule, that was the time that the channels need to switch again.

Channel 9 should be ashamed of themselves. The experience was utterly woeful and embarassing.

### But you could watch it online!?

Yes I know that. In fact, the coverage was that bad I was often happier watching broken, pixellated, buffering footage of the games online through our crap quality Internet connections. But that's beside the point. Footage wasn't technically available in Australia through online channels. This means that to the mainstream watching things online isn't even an option. Only those people moderately technical, or knew someone who was, could find a way of streaming footage from the BBC's website. The rest of the population were stuck with Channel 9.

### Why not get Fox then, you tight arse?

Another good question. Why? Because our family isn't big on watching TV most of the time. We don't spend that much time in front of the TV at all. Therefore having a typical pay TV subcription is just silly. We couldn't justify the cost for the very few times we'd actually watch it.

However, I _would_ have considered buying an Olympic package. That is, a package where I could pay for 16 days of use so that I could watch any event at any time, without the pain of frequent ad breaks, Cameron's crappy interviews, awful repeats and inappropriate ad content. Unfortunately this kind of package wasn't available. A short-term lease of a line for something like this just isn't an option.

I also think that forcing people in to pay TV just to get a decent coverage isn't right for something like the Olympics. It seems to go against the spirit/meaning of it for me. To each his own.

With that out of the way, let's take a look at the news articles.

## Negative news

This subtitle says it all. On the whole, the news coverage was a debacle. Stores focussed on what people _didn't_ achieve as compared to what they did. They talked about how everyone was disappointed that someone didn't win. They used phrases like "the wrong colour" when referring to medals. Basically they took shots at as many atheletes as they could. The stories of success were lost in a sea of journalistic negativity.

I grabbed a few snaps of news coverage from a couple of Australia news websites to show you what I mean.

-- images go here --

It doesn't take a genius to realise that this kind of coverage has a negative impact on the athletes themselves. One athlete even stated, for the record, that many people are struggling to deal with the pressure and the stress that are imposed on them by the media ridiculous expectations. Good on him for saying that. I couldn't agree more. "Gold or nothing" is an awful attitude to have yet that was the sentiment of many of the articles that I read.

Athletes were also unfairly portrayed. Poor Stephanie Rice was made to look like she was really unhappy when she won a silver medal. I doubt very much that this was the case. In my view, she was utterly shattered because in the eyes of the Australian public she had "failed". Bullshit. Steph, you gave it everything you had. We all saw that. It doesn't matter if you come last, what matters is that you were there and you threw every ounce of effort into it. Though we have no connection whatsoever other than the small chance of us living in the same country, I am proud of you. Not because you're Australia, or because you won a medal, but because you worked your ass off. Kudos to you and every other athelete that did the same. F$@k the media and their shitty comments.
