title: "List o' Software"
---
Just a quick one this morning. I have starting gathering a list of software applications that I use all the time (or will use) which I find to be good. There's quite a few of these lists out there already, but I thought I'd comment on the stuff that I find useful and give you guys the chance to have a play with them yourself. If you think you know of something that is worthy, let me know and I'll check it out.

The list will be growing constantly as I find more time to add to it, and so it'll remain on it's own page which can be found <a href="/software-list/" title="Software List">over here</a> (there's also a permanent link in the side-bar).
