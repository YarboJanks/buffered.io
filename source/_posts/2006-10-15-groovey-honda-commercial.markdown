Just a quick post for you guys this morning. Me ol' mucka Tommy Lee pointed me at a cool website this morning with a link to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvlUUkx1QPc" title="YouTube - The Best Honda Commercial Ever" target="_blank">YouTube - The Best Honda Commercial Ever</a>. Very cool stuff! Check it out. Apparently, all the sound effects were made by people!
