title: "Pumpkin Computer"
---
I had to post this for the masses/geeks to enjoy (though chances are that you've already seen it if you're a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/" title="Gizmodo" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a> reader). Some chap decided to make himself a <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/pcs/pumpkin-computer-just-like-mom-used-to-make-209299.php" title="Pumpkin Computer: Just Like Mom Used to Make - Gizmodo" target="_blank">computer made from a pumpkin</a> (well, for the chassis). Yup, another geek with too much time (and pumpkin) on his hands. I wonder how long it's going to take before it starts to stink!
