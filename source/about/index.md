title: About OJ
---

I'm a married father of two who lives on the East Coast of Australia. I started my career in Sydney as a software developer in January 1999 and since then have managed to work on some pretty fun (and not so fun) stuff. From acounting software to encryption, ministerial correspondence to VOIP, mission planning to console games, mobile games, high-scale web sites, Internet banking systems, and more. I've had a great time along the way and have met some amazing people.

At the beginning of 2013 I decided to change my focus. I was looking for a new challenge, a new area to throw myself into, but something that I knew I had a keen interest in. This is what led me to Security.

Since then I've managed to acquire both [OSCP][] and [OSCE][], and am very much enjoying the [security-related work][met_work] that I have been fortunate enough to be involved with. I'm a regular committer and contributer to the [Metasploit][] project, and am a proud member of the [Corelan Team][].

If you'd like to reach out and say hi please head over to the [contact][] page.
