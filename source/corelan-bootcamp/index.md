It is an extreme honour to announce that industry guru Peter Van Eeckhoutte, founder of [Corelan][] and expert in the ways of exploit development, is coming Down Under to teach the [Corelan Live Win32 Exploit Development Bootcamp][bootcamp]! This course is recognised world-wide by many a security professional for its quality, depth and educational value. Anyone interested in drastically improving their abilities in the field of exploit discovery and development would benefit enormously from attending this bootcamp.

Peter, who normally resides in the Northern Hemisphere, has decided to make the trek to Sydney to share his expertise. To aid him in his journey, local Brisbane-based security firm Beyond Binary has offered to help with the administration and organisation, while none other than BAE Systems has offered up a fantastic venue in the heart of the Sydney CBD and will be supporting the event further by providing lunch for those who attend.

The details of the course can be found [on the Corelan Training website][bootcamp], and will be held over 3 days, starting on the 17th December 2014 and finishing on the 19th. To be eligible to attend the course you need to be able to:

* Provide official photograph identification on commencement of the course.
* Abstain from recording any of the course at any time.
* Sign an NDA in order to receive the course material.
* Use the course material for your own learning **only**. It may not be used as a reference point for creation of other material.

This is close to a once in a lifetime opportunity to have someone of Peter's calibre impart his impressive knowledge _on shore_. Make the most of it! If you're interested in attending, don't wait as seats are limited to just 30. You can purchase tickets via our [EventBrite][] page, or start your purchase by using the form below (which redirects you to [EventBrite][]):

If you are looking to claim attendance on your tax return, or choose to have your employer pay, then please make sure you choose the ticket that includes GST. Failing to do so will mean that a receipt will not be available to you.

Given the nature of the effort that Peter is making to come to Australia, refunds are _not_ permitted once the ticket has been bought. However, transfers to other people are permitted up to 14 days prior to the event so long as they agree to adhere to the requirements of course attendance.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact me directly][contact_direct].

I, for one, am extremely excited about this opportunity and have already taken the first seat. Come and join me! I look forward to seeing you there.
